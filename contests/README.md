* [497]: This data presented participants with two captions and asked the user
  to choose the funniest caption. It has roughly **23k responses.**
* [499]: This contains the data from an experiment included in a video from
  Robert Mankoff's desk titled "[Cartoon Lounge: Show Me the Funny]". This
  experiment provided the caption "rate the below caption as unfunny, somewhat
  funny or funny." It has roughly **103k responses**.
* [505]: Another cartoon contest. We have roughly **123k responses** for **377
  participants**. This experiment recruited participants through a New Yorker
  mailing list.
* [507] through [513]: each experiment has roughly **100k** responses from less
  than 500 participants. These participants were previous caption contest
  winners. 507 through 513 have roughly 700k responses total. 508 and 509 have
  both types of experiments (both cardinal and dueling bandits)
* [514]: Roughly **200k** responses from **10k** participants. This experiment
  was hosted on http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/vote and participants were
  recruited by the New Yorker more generally (through a mailing list)
