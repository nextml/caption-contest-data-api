My insurance doesn't cover prehistoric conditions.
Home confinement isn't so bad, but the ankle bracelet is killing me.
It's only on for a month and then just some community service
Yes he’s a herbivore. Unfortunately I’m Herb.
Have you seen my other Croc?
He has trouble with "heel" and for God's sake please don't say B - A - L - L.
The doctor said it will eventually just go extinct.
Somebody carve 9-1-1.
"I believe I accidentally set off your security system".
It counts your steps and keeps your heart-rate up.
My wife said to ignore it, since what it wants is attention; but then again, my wife is missing.
I'm under cave arrest.
Achilles? What kind of a name is Achilles?
On the plus side, he doesn't shed.
He's a rescue. Ate his last family.
Turns out... the bark wasn't that bad.
As soon as we discover fire, we're going to eat him.
So far he understands Sit, Fetch, and Roll Over but Heel is painfully problematic.
I have this idea called "pet", but I haven't ironed out all the details.
I can't understand why people think these Crocs are so comfortable.
It would mean a lot if you guys didn't cave-paint this.
Luckily for me, I have Obamacare and they're still covering prehistoric conditions.
I am so ready for mammals.
Since the meteor hit, he's become very clingy.
He was so cute as an egg.
Before I leave there's something that's been gnawing at me.
Let me give you some advice: don’t try to drain the swamp
Have you seen my other Croc?
Monitor lizard.
A little obedience training, and a couple million years of evolution, and you're looking at man's best friend.
Yes, well, perhaps 'domesticated' is too strong a word.
Just give me a minute to disarm the security system.
You always find an excuse for not going out to dinner with us.
The garbage disposal is acting up again.
He is costing me an arm and a leg to feed.
The good news is he's nearly extinct.
"Would you mind turning-off your home security system"!
Actually, his bark is worse.
Fuck the New Yorker. There's nothing funny about this!
He understood the "Heel" command right away.
I found out why they call him an ankylosauros.
Forget the wheel. Can you invent the chew toy?
All I said was he'd make a beautiful pair of shoes?
He's on the caveman diet.
I'd love to but I'm still under cave arrest.
He's gotten very attached to me.
My God, we all have one eye!
I thought Crocs were supposed to be comfortable!
Is Ouch a word yet?
I'm on cave arrest until my hearing
It counts my steps.
They said "Adopt two so they can play with each other", but I didn't listen.
All I said was "Heel."
It's time for his walk.
Mom? Dad? Does our healthcare cover prehistoric conditions?
Apparently I taste like chicken...
It's called a FitBit.
He always knows when we're going on a trip.
As far as I'm concerned, they can't become extinct fast enough.
We're still working on 'heel.'
He's a Tyrannodoodle, so he's hypoallergenic.
With all this talk of extinction, he's afraid of being left alone.
I got three months cave arrest and an Ankylosaurus monitor.
We're still having some attachment issues.
House arrest -- ankle monitor.
Hey guys, have you seen my other croc?
Have either of you seen my other Croc?
It only hurts when I move or when I don't move.
But he's a total chick magnet.
Something about him just grabbed me.
He was a wedding present from my mother-in-law!
He'll sit, lie down, and fetch, but he's unclear on 'Heel."
Let's pick something else to call man's best friend.
Actually, our relationship is evolving.
We're still working on 'heel.'
As far as I'm concerned, they can't become extinct fast enough.
Somethings been gnawing at me lately.
He's a purebred. Cost me an arm and a leg!
How do I disable the alarm again?
Well I would have gotten a cat, but I'm allergic.
I forgot the password.
He's become attached to me.
I caught it. You cook it.
The Vet says it might be separation anxiety.
Well the Henderson's had such great success with domesticating the dog, and the Taylor's with the sheep - I just thought to myself, "How hard can it be?"
...and they asked me if I'd tried turning it off and back on again.
I think he's on the Paleo diet.
You can't defeat the ankle monitor, but it can de-feet you.
In this instance the bark isn't worse .
He’s great with kids though
Yah, I posted bail - but Judge Ogg thought I was a flight risk.
I think he's just pulling my leg.
It lets me know when I reach ten thousand steps.
He still has some attachment issues.
It won't be quite so cute when he weighs 20 tons.
Sarah said; See you later, alligator. I said; Catch you in a while crocodile... I guess he thought we were mocking him...
It's not the breed; it's how they're raised.
Unfortunately I can only demonstrate this security system once.
They told me about attachment issues but I never expected this.
I'll wait here while you invent tools.
Maybe we should try domesticating wolves instead.
He’s a rescue and we’re working through a few issues.
So if you could just make the petroglyph showing me with a spear chasing this guy, I think the anthropologists would be more impressed with who we were as a people.
It's a new kind of currency called bitecoin.
Turns out it’s a “gatored” community
Extinct my ass.
The ankle monitor should come off after my next court hearing.
I agree that dinosaurs died out long before the first hominids, but that statement, as valid as it is, doesn't really solve my problem.
I'm under cave arrest, this is my ankle monitor.
He identifies as a predator.
We're still having a problem with "Heel".
Has he had his shots?
The upside is I made bail.
He is pretty much housebroken but we still have to work on his separation anxiety.
I can't go, I'm grounded tonight.
I can't go anywhere without him.
Sorry...still on cave arrest
At least he doesn't shed.
No, he just ate Stephanie so we're good for a couple of hours till he's hungry again. Come on in!
Trust me, crocks are the next big thing in footwear.
Bob Mueller says it will come off after I testify.
Unfortunately I can't go to the hospital - it's not a pre-historic condition.
All I can say is do NOT ignore parking tickets.
Just four more weeks of cave arrest and the ankle monitor lizard comes off.
Our fault ... we trained him to hunt for bones.
Can't go. I'm still under cave arrest.
He's become quite attached to me.
He knows “fetch”, and we’re working on “drop it”.
I can come with you, but he's going to be a drag.
The alternative was a monkey on my back.
I'm hoping he'll be extinct soon.
The exterminator comes on Wednesdays. Would you like to see the rest of the cave?
The good thing is he doesn't bark.
I've just invented pliers.
What can I say? He’s a rescue.
So I was going to club him but turns out he's on the endangered species list.
The breeder told us he's emotionally VERY stable and VERY intelligent.
Possessive? How do you mean?
We have a safe word.
Ankle bitelet - house arrest.
I just said 'heel'.
She gets upset when I try to leave for work.
Hi, my name is Achilles.
Shouldn't have said, "Heel!"
I don’t mind the house arrest but I hate the ankle bracelet.
...only when it laughs.
I forgot to disable the alarm.
Sorry, not ready to go out yet. I have to finish shaving my legs.
House arrest isn’t so bad, but this ankle bracelet is starting to chafe
Okay, who left the door uninvented?
Looks like dinner's on me!
I wouldn't say he's my BEST friend, but he's growing on me.
His name is Chewy.
He followed me home.
I thought the pet-sitting ad said, "Playful and loving," not "Painful and numbing."
It hurt at first but you get used it.
It’s my pet peeve.
Don’t worry. He is a trained service animal.
I still think I can pass him off as my emotional support animal.
He cost me an arm and a leg.
He's just teething.
We're very close.
Well, this will shock no one, but Spike failed obedience training. Again.
Apparently, his mother was a world-famous handbag.
Meet my wife's divorce lawyer.
But enough about me. How was the show?
I'm really more of a cat person.
He's very loyal.
I was put on cave arrest.
I’m still on cave arrest
Go without me. I'm under house arrest.
"I just start biting them. It's like a magnet. Just bite. I don't even wait. And when you're a dinosaur, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the tibia".
It's a metaphysical question. Do we own our pets or do they own us?
Forget the wheel. Someone needs to invent the Frisbee.
I pled down to house arrest and an ankle monitor!
House arrest I can take. What keeps gnawing at me is the guilt.
He thinks I’m the mailman.
He’s become very attached.
Fluffy? Are you sure that’s a good name?
They said his previous owners couldn't be found.
He should evolve out of it.
My mistake. I said don't bite the hand that feeds you.
It was either cave arrest, or death by triceratops.
On the bright side, he solved my rat problem
His issues with attachment aren’t evolving the way we’d like.
In a smaller dinosaur, this would be considered a love bite.
He’s a rescue. Who knows what he’s been through?
He's on the Paleo diet.
" Cave arrest......It'll be off by Summer".
He's looking for attention; just ignore him.
Sorry, I can't go. I'm on cave arrest.
Don't make eye contact...DO..NOT..MAKE..EYE CONTACT!
He looked so sweet and helpless at the shelter.
He is an Ankylosaurus.
I lost the other one in the laundry.
I prefer to call it a strong sense of attachment.
He's still at that clingy stage.
Well let me tell you, his bark is even worse.
How do you like my Jimmy Chew shoe?
I'm about to invent the lawsuit.
It was this or jail time.
#MeToo
I got to keep the dog, she got everything else.
The wheel will have to wait, I'm going to invent swearing.
I'm actually more troubled by the anachronism.
At least he doesn't hump.
Our relationship is evolving.
This is our newest little ankle bitter.
The ankle monitor is a pain, but it beats sitting in jail
My big mistake was calling him Bannon.
He's a rescue with separation anxiety issues.
Other than that, I slept really well.
Actually, his bark is worse.
I really need to work on his separation anxiety issue.
I'm looking forward to being a cat person.
I hate demonstrating these security systems.
I said "heel"
As a pet, they become quite attached to you.
My other option was to surrender my passport.
It's going to evolve into a loyal, loving companion called a cat.
The judge gave me six months of cave arrest.
He probably heard us say we were having you over for lunch.
I'm trying to teach him to heel.
I’m done for ... save yourselves.
He gets a little insecure when we have new people over.
Some days you eat the stegosaurus. Other days it eats you.
He blames me for the divorce
You should hear his bark.
I think I have foot in mouth disease.
I'm just glad we chose the teacup.
Before I fired him, Steve, here, was my Chief Strategist and sat on the National Security Council
I'm hoping he'll be extinct soon.
The great thing is, he doesn’t shed.
No jail time, but I have to wear an ankle bracelet for three weeks.
Yes, yes, I know. But he promised to make my cave great again.
Can’t make it out today, I’m still under cave arrest.
What's eating you?
Welcome home. Now, about my pet-sitter fee.
No Agatha, I don't think that's why its called an Ankylosaurus.
Quick! Invent surgery!
The judge said they'll take it off in two moons if I stay in my cave.
He was shy at first, but we’ve become quite attached.
He looked smaller in the cave painting.
Obviously the Judge considers me a flight risk.
Can he keep me?
Can we keep him, Mom? Please?
He gets so excited when I get back to the cave.
The good news is no one notices my limp anymore!
Soon, one of us will be extinct.
Maybe I should just meet you there.
I dreamt last night that some day judges might just require a small plastic bracelet
"I'm under cave arrest until the trial by fire".
It's an evolving relationship.
They’re known for their unconditional love.
I got sentenced to 6 months cave arrest.
“Get a pet,” they said. “You’ll have fun,” they said.
The plea bargain included cave confinement with an anklesaur bracelet.
It qualifies as a pre-existing condition.
She's a little possessive, true, but the thing is she makes me laugh.
I'd sue the pet store, but I won't have a leg to stand on.
after a couple of days you don't even know he's there
It's a prehistoric condition.
Let's keep looking. I have a bad feeling about this one.
All those unpaid parking tickets finally caught up with me.
Actually, teaching him not to pee in the cave was a lot worse.
It's the weirdest thing- it takes away my back pain!
No, he's not an armadillo, he's a legadillo.
I call it a 'Fitbit.'
It's called a "pet."
I guess house arrest is better than being in jail.
He's a wonderful pet but it costs an arm and a leg to feed him.
His bark is worse than his bite.
Apparently, I just have to wait for him to die out.
I’d rather you amputate his head.
It was cute when he was little.
I know he's extinct. Try telling him that.
Do you guys remember the code for the alarm?
I'm considered a flight risk.
Cave arrest isn't as comfy as I thought it would be
I don't think this "pet" thing will ever catch on.
Sure it hurts, but that’s fashion.
I was hoping for more of an emotional attachment.
Only if I think about it.
I parked in a toe-away zone.
He's very clingy.
He's very attached.
My wife got a matching bracelet.
Frankly he hasn't grasped the concept of 'heel' yet.
Mental note. Don’t say “bite me”to a literalsaurus.
I couldn't afford a fitbit.
My security system has a few glitches.
These new ankle monitors are barely noticeable
we all seem to have one eye
I can't wait until they invent a leash.
He's still teething. He'll evolve out of it.
Some extictions can't come soon enough.
Nothing much, what's up with you two?
He's been extinct for 65 million years so I'm just as surprised to see him as you are.
The wife wanted a dog, but those won’t be domesticated for another 3,000 years.
No, go without me I shouldn't ignore this gnawing feeling.
The teething is killing me.
I got three months probation and I can’t go more than 50 feet from the cave.
Please crop him out of the cave painting.
I brought him home to eat, but I think he misunderstood.
It was a lot cuter as a puppy
Honestly, I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't said anything.
Good question. Where IS my wife?
Apparently I owe more than $350 in outstanding parking violations.
The original plan was to eat him, but then we got attached.
Is this what they mean by Snapchat?
I mean yeah it hurts, but its not like I can afford insurance in this economy.
I'm still glad we didn't get a cat.
Obviously not as extinct as you might think.
Is it really that noticeable?
I wouldn't mind letting him go extinct.
Have either of you seen Ethel?.
On the plus-side, he’s using the litter box now.
I need to invent the Chew Toy.
You never really know what you’re getting with a rescue.
You were right. Pet's really do tie you down.
The court ordered me to wear it until the end of the stone age.
I just have to wait it out until he goes extinct.
Jim, did you forget to feed the legosaurus?
My parole officer says it comes off in 6 weeks with good behavior.
...and the sellers are also including their burglar alarm system.
I always manage to lose one when I do laundry.
He's been clingy ever since that asteroid last week.
The fines don’t even cover feeding the ankle monitor...
I considered getting a "dog", but I hear that their bark is even worse than their bite.
It’s not news unless I bite him.
It's from the government and it's here to help us.
Regretfully I won’t be able to attend the Bronze Age.
This just started, I think it's the new cave.
House arrest.
C’mon in, just try not to wake up her big brother.
I would sue, but I don't have a leg to stand on.
Dont' worry, he doesn't shed.
He’s teething.
I'm beginning to regret rescuing him from extinction.
He really puts the sore in dinosaur
Call me the eternal optimist, but I see a future in which they will give us unconditional love.
It’s called an ankle monitor, but I think it wants to eat me.
I didn't mind so much when he was smaller.
I don’t think we quite understand the food chain yet
They told us he was vegan.
He's very attached to me.
I'm inventing shoes for him to chew
How the Ankylosaurus got its name.
Yes, it's evolving into a problem.
Our search for man's best friend continues.
It's fine. She's just teething.
I had no idea I was going to get this attached to him.
Apparently I'm under cave arrest.
He's a rescue.
It's not really his fault, he's a rescue.
Yes I'm up for a walk but I can't do hills.
I would, but it's an endangered species.
I couldn't care less whether it's an alligator or a crocodile.
So, like I said, he needs his suppositories three times a day, prefers tuna steaks for meals, and he LOVES kids.
He doesn't bark........so yes, the bite is much worse.
He has separation anxiety.
It's a Legosaurus.
It’s cheaper than a leash
Right now we're both trying the Paleo thing.
It’s not so much the biting. It’s the licking.
She is supposed to evolve, but it is taking forever.
He suffers from separation anxiety.
Yea, I stopped work on the wheel so I could focus all of my energies on inventing the muzzle.
I hate the teething stage.
I think we should try once more domesticating that wolf instead
He loves having people for dinner.
So far it has cost me an arm.
The judge gave me thirty days of cave arrest and an ankle monitor.
Help me find his chew toy.
Extinct my foot !
I'm on cave arrest.
I am thinking of inventing fire so we can barbeque him.
He's a great companion, completely housebroken, eats anything.
This was the condition for my cave arrest
You'll actually find her quite charming once the numbness sets in.
I can't come. I'm under cave arrest.
I can't wait for the leash to be invented.
Sorry I can't hunt or gather. I'm under house arrest.
I only have to wear it while on house arrest.
I only wear the ankle monitor until trial.
You think that hurts? Just wait until they invent high heels.
He's still teething.
Well I like to think he rescued me.
First known incident of somebody saying "he's pulling your leg."
Sometimes he takes the heel command too literally.
This is my Ankylosaurus.
House arrest bites.
He gets confused when I tell him to heel.
All I said was get your own dinner for once.
You're sure it's a herbivore?
Do you know how to get rid of bed bugs?
Obviously, this won't work. Maybe we try dog next.
It beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.
To be fair, I did tell him not to bite the 'hand' that feeds him.
I'm waiting for it to become extinct.
This is Bitey.
It's an Ankle-sore-us.
My profession? I'm a mailman.
He suffers from a little separation anxiety.
His name is Izod.
But he was so playful at the pound.
So nice of you to drop in for a bite.
I still prefer him to a cat.
He'll be extinct soon.
This time I've really put my foot in it.
It could be worse. Our last one was a humper.
He said the cave painting makes him look fat.
He's a shelter dinosaur.
...and somehow this is MY fault?
Go figure. The guy at the pet shop said he only ate lettuce.
It could be worse...he could be humping my leg.
Come on in, and watch your limbs; spot is teething.
We used to be attached at the hip.
In retrospect, jail was the better option.
They said it's a pre-existing condition.
We're working on his separation anxiety.
I look just like the mailman.
The vet says it's just a bad case of separation anxiety.
Sorry. He’s a rescue.
Have you guys seen my other shoe?
The asteroid should be here any minute now.
I don't know what to do about his separation anxiety.
Let’s domesticate wolves instead
Don't get one with separation anxiety issues .
It's the latest police technology. I'm under cave arrest until further notice.
Spike has attachment issues.
It's called cave arrest.
I can't find the leash, but we should be okay.
Cave arrest is such a drag!
I found her on “Ancestry.com”
It looks like I'll be on cave arrest until the trial
Sorry, guys. Can't go out tonight. My wife found out what we did last time.
I should've gotten a saber-tooth, cats are never needy.
You guys are so Neanderthal. All the kids are wearing them at school.
He's pretty calm until I take a shower.
The problem with pets is that they get so attached to you.
The pet store said this breed becomes attached easily.
My parole officer considers me a flight risk.
Yes, I'm on cave arrest.
Yeah, but it hardly sheds...
I've become very attached to the little fellow
I can't find the release button.
It's a monitor lizard. I'm under cave arrest.
He's usually more cuddly.
My lawyer is sure they'll remove it after the trial.
Crocs are in but they kill my ankles
I'm afraid you'll have to go gathering without me; I'm under cave arrest.
It gets clingy when we have company.
Well, let's just say, I'm looking forward to teething being over.
I’m not supposed to hurt him. He’s an endangered species.
It’s just a love bite. He’s really very friendly.
I fear it will be eons before he's domesticated.
I just hope he goes extinct before I do.
He followed me home....can I keep him ?
It’s an existential struggle.
Here there be dragons
I was thinking of naming him Ankylosaurus...but it's already taken,apparently.
Sorry I can't leave, I am under cave arrest.
Go outside they said, it'll be fun they said...
I can't wait for them to invent ankle monitors.
My parole officer said I could shower with this one.
My eyes are up here
He was a great chick magnet until he ate the last one.
His chew toy rolled under the couch.
I can't tonight, I'm still under cave arrest.
It's a new thing I'm working on. I call it 'shoe'.
Can I keep him? He followed me home. He seems hungry.
It's for hunting and gathering under the influence.
He's not a carnivore. He just thinks I'm broccoli.
Rescues get so attached.
Yeah well he's hypoallergenic so that's a plus.
He obviously misunderstood when I said, “Heel!”
Did I forget to tell you I'm under cave arrest?
Yeah, I got home detention with a monitor. It's a real pain.
It beats a prison cell.
I'm running a fever and they were out of leeches.
It was the smallest ankle monitor they had.
Full grown we expect him to be over 5 tons.
Ever since I brought him home from the shelter, he's been very attached to me.
He’s somewhat overprotective.
I'd ask if we can keep him but I don't think it matters what you say.
As you can see, this cave comes with a state-of-the-art security system.
He followed me home! Can we keep him?
Sorry guys I’m under cave arrest until the end of the month.
The breeder said he has "attachment" issues.
‘It’s either separation anxiety or I taste like chicken.’
The staff at the Rescue said he will outgrow the chewing phase in a million years or so.
His bite is worse than his bark.
He's on the Paleo diet.
Guess what happens if I violate the conditions of my parole.
He seemed further away.
All I said was 'fetch'.
Ugg have two more weeks of cave-arrest.
They determined I was a flight risk.
I’m under cave arrest. He comes off tomorrow.
Buster knows don’t bite the hand that feeds you, but he’s not good extrapolating.
This way I don't need a leash.
Thank god they've invented the wheel, because I need an ambulance.
Separation anxiety..he knows the Cretaceous Period ends next week
He's got attachment issues.
I keep saying "Heel." He keeps hearing "Ankle."
The upside is he keeps the unit rodent free.
They call it "house arrest."
I'm on cave arrest.
I forgot the password.
He gets this way when I'm about to leave for a few days.
I forgot the alarm code.
I'm just lucky to still have a leg to stand on
The vet says he's just teething.
In a future lifetime, I will be delivering something called "mail".
I have to wear it on my ankle until my next court appearance.
We thought about a dog but we didn't want to be tied down.
My leash invention is still in the conceptual stage.
The worst part is when I have to tell Fred & Wilma about this little mishap with their chainsaw.
If his behavior doesn't improve, we'll have to put him up for extinction.
I'd love to join you, but I'm under house-a-rex.
I'm under Cave Arrest. One step outside and it eats me.
They say I'm a flight risk.
They're very loyal but tend to only bond with one person.
No, it is not house arrest. It is farm to table dinner- if we only had a a table.
He's the hunter and I'm the gatherer.
Well, domestication takes several generations.
“Next time I think I will just draw from memory.’
I was told it's not the breed, it's the owners.
My sentence is ten years or his extinction. Whichever comes first.
He's not letting go until I admit we do not co-exist historically.
My lawyer says I got off easy with house arrest, given all the stone tablets I leaked.
I got three months house arrest, can you bring me a pepperoni pizza and a small animal for him?
It´s a condition of my house arrest.
I told you we should have gotten a door.
I was told I'd have to wear it until my trial.
No matter how much he begs, whatever you do, don't buy a Chompasaurus for your kid.
I got caught painting on walls again. I have to wear this for 30 days.
could we not just invent a ball and chain
Please say I can keep him . . . I'm already so attached.
Sorry but I've been under cave arrest and have to wear this monitor lizard until the trial.
He's having one of his clingy days.
I'm out, but I'm under house arrest.
Could you loan me 20 fish? I didn't catch enough to make my "protection" payment this week.
It is NOT my turn. I walked her this morning.
Not everything is a Trump joke!
As soon as I said "heel" he got it. Still not sure they make the best pets.
Got anything that isn't quite so tight around the ankles?
I can't afford to remove it. My health insurance plan doesn't cover prehistoric creatures.
I can’t seem to get a leg up.
A stegosaurus is an *outside* pet, I said.
I’m kind of getting attached to him.
I miss my cat.
He's into paleo dieting.
Judge said I can only leave to hunt or gather...
I posted bail, but they insisted I had to wear this ankle bracelet.
Give him time, he's still evolving.
So until the trial I've been put on house arrest.
This cave is going to cost you an arm and a leg.
Actually, the worst part of house arrest isn't the loss of freedom; it's the gnawing guilt.
Can the old ball and chain come too?
It's a service dinosaur.
It turns out that domesticating an animal takes a few generations.
The vet says it’s just separation anxiety.
It’s a new thing called “house arrest.”
I was lucky. Just house arrest and an ankle monitor.
You told me these things were extinct!
On the flip side, I've discovered a new species.
...we aren't quite sure. He's a rescue.
A roommate is a small price to pay. Have you seen these ceilings?
Next time I watch him, leave his chew toy.
He's having difficulty with the 'heel' command.
Sorry, I'm on home confinement.
It's better than prison, but if I go more than 50 feet from the cave, it will eat me.
He's become very attached to me lately.
It's better than an albatross around the neck
I think I'm more of a cat person.
It's progress. We used to be attached at the hip.
He's very attached.
It was a condition of my bail.
On second thought, you should probably go along without me.
The judge says I have to wear this for six months, and I can't leave the cave.
Mom, Dad, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
I know he looks mean, but I've become rather attached to him.
Don't worry, they'll soon be extinct
At least I still have Obamacare.
He's hypoallergenic and a rescue, which is tough to find.
When you were told 'Zook loves people', you should have asked for clarification.
She finally snapped.
It's just a little love bite.
I've been naturally selected
The doctor said to keep it on until Thursday
You were right. We should try to domesticate bears.
Actually, I prefer it. His bark is worse than his bite.
High ceilings, open loft layout and the best part, pet friendly.
My parole officer said it'll come off in a few weeks.
The shelter said he was part anklylosaurus.
Believe it or not, it's a service lizard.
Get a pet, they said. It'll be fun, they said.
We're pretty sure he'll eventually evolve into a chihuahua.
Turns out he's an omnivore.
He is a herding dinasour. He will not let me leave the cave.
Yeah. Grounded.
Any word from the exterminator?
I'm beginning to think there might be other animals out there who are better suited for domestication.
The vet thinks it might be separation anxiety.
Did either of you bring the Jaws of Life?
The look makes more sense with the matching handbag
Is that an alligator shoe, or a Croc?
He's my home arrest monitor...
Please listen carefully, as our menu options have recently changed.
Believe me, his bark is much worse!
It's a codependasaurus.
He's a rescue, but he seems to resent me.
He's at that I'm-gonna-bite-off-your-leg age, but he's such a sweetheart.
Forgot to feed him again, didn't you?
I swear, I paid that ticket months ago.
It was a rescue dinosaur
It’s not the breed, it’s how they were raised.
The vet says it's just the age he's going through.
It's only news when I bite him.
Since we rescued him from the shelter he's become very attached.
It says to cover his head with petroleum jelly or tug firmly with tweezers, but maybe I misidentified what it is?
He prefers meat on the bone.
This ankle monitor is getting to be a real pain.
Oh, Mom! All the kids are wearing them.
He’s pretty attached to me.
They are extinct but this one keeps clinging on.
And then I said, “You’re just pulling my leg.”
He is a mini tyrannodoodle.
Cave arrest. And not permitted to carry a club for six months.
The jail cave is full so the judge sentenced me to house arrest.
I’m just happy I got my underwear on before it happened.
I was sentenced to home confinement.
With any luck he will be extinct in a few months.
The shelter said he has abandonment issues.
He's a leg man.
Unfortunately, he has attachment issues.
Got a launch date yet for those pliers you've been working on?
The Judge called it monitor and cave arrest.....
It's a service reptile.
Apparently, I'm delicious.
The ankle monitor comes off next week
I’m really looking forward to the invention of the ball and chain.
So I was driving down the highway when this tail-gator bit me from behind.
It's called an ankle monitor lizard.
Okay, YOU try telling him he shouldn’t exist.
The doctor recommended that I leave it on for a week or so and I'll be as good as new.
Mom, Dad! He followed me home, can I keep him?
Playful and fun as a kid, then teenage hormones--WHOA!--LOOK OUT!
Sorry, can’t. Still on parole.
I can't wait until they invent a leash.
That's why I am a cat person.
He doesn't shed. And you won't have a rat problem.
As a rescue from Paleolithic, he's still learning how to let go.
I'm afraid that he has gotten too attached.
We were playing rock, paper, scissors.
He's almost extinct so I give him some slack.
It’d mean a lot to me if you guys knocked before coming in
They gave me 3 months of house arrest.
It's court ordered....I'm on Cave Arrest
I was hoping he'd evolve out of it
Yeah, so, because I'm a celebrity, I'm only on house arrest and just have to keep this ankle bracelet on for six months.
He lets go when I get to ten thousand steps.
Have you seen grandma?
He's due to become extinct next week, but I don't know if I can wait that long.
He’s become very attached.
Fido's new paleo diet's gonna cost me an arm and a leg.
Just because the Neanderthals have pets doesn’t make it a good idea.
He came with a password, but I forgot !
Our initial thought was separation anxiety. But now we're leaning towards hunger.
Doctor Stonehenge said the treatment would be painless. It must be working because right now I can’t feel my leg...
I didn't choose him. He chose me!
Feeding him is costing an arm and a leg.
Now can I stay home from school??
He's a little anxious whenever we have company.
Only two more months of cave arrest then I'm outta here.
It measures my vital signs and sends them all to an app.
His "grrraaaccckkk" is worse than his bite.
He's got attachment issues.
It was a cave warming gift.
It's a little annoying, but I'm sure he'll evolve out of it.
I told her it was over but she just won't let go.
Three month's cave arrest.
And I’m never buying an As Seen On TV vacuum again.
Domestication is taking longer than I anticipated.
Better this than him humping my leg.
I tried to get the landlord to spray the place but you know how it is.
Do we still have our receipt from Herbivores-R-Us?
Sorry to disturb you folks, but would you have a Jaws of Life I might borrow?
I'm on house arrest.
He’s become very attached to me.
Did you remember the doggie treats?
He's really very attached to me.
So, would you like to see the upstairs?
He says he was here first.
It's a new thing I call snapchat
What would a Neanderthal do?
Cave arrest, this is my ankle monitor
The judge told me I had to wear an ankle bracelet.
... and in about an hour the whole cave floor is polished.
'We've decided to eat in tonight.'
Well, he's a rescue so we're still socializing him.
It's OK. He just smells my stegosaurus.
You know how it is when they get their first 40 teeth.
It's not so bad. Cave arrest is so much better than the alternative.
I'm serving the remainder of my sentence under house arrest.
I wish they were extinct already.
On the bright side, I no longer need the leash.
We're still working on the separation anxiety.
He's so attached to me. Can't I keep him?
What would happen if he didn't like me?
He came with the cave.
I can't - I'm still on house arrest.
It's only for thirty days and then I do community service.
It’s been attached to me so for long that I don’t really notice it anymore.
I think we’re making really good progress at establishing me as the Alpha.
He takes the heel command too literally.
It costs an arm and a leg to keep him.
Two months of cave arrest? That bites.
We’re still working on ‘leave it.’
Yeah, it hurts like hell, but everyone at school has one!
Cave arrest bites.
Another month and the ankle bracelet comes off.
He has evolution anxiety.
In a few millennia, they’ll call it a “cat”.
He's still adjusting to the mammal takeover.
I made eye contact.
My vet suggested prozac.
He's just being playful but it's making my ankylosaur.
I forgot to feed her.
It comes with the polo shirt
The anachronism hurts me more than the bite.
Doc says I can take the Splintosaurus off in a few weeks.
It may not look like it, but it's his way of showing affection.
I fed it once and now it won't let me out of its sight.
This is just one condition of my house arrest. You don't want to know the others.
My question is, will this be considered a pre-existing condition?
It's okay. He's been vaccinated.
Well, at least he doesn't shed.
We're very devoted to each other but here must be an easier way to take him for a walk.
My sentence? An ankle bracelet for 30 days.
I have this gnawing feeling that it wants more from me than I want to give.
Separation anxiety.
Home confinement was part of the plea deal.
He's a Legasoreus
I found an attachment-disorder therapist with a great Groupon deal.
I've got another two weeks under house arrest.
I can't wait until he's extinct.
Well, he doesn’t shed.
The ankle monitor lizard is a condition of my cave arrest.
I'd rather have a monkey on my back, but they don't exist yet.
The caveowners' association only bans pit bulls.
His separation anxiety is beginning to gnaw at me.
So I say, “Do you think they ‘saur’ us?” and, well, you can see what happened next.
It's an ankle monitor lizard. Goes with the cave arrest.
I know, I know. But domestication doesn't happen overnight.
We're just going through a phase.
My inspiration for the first mother-in-law joke.
Oh, I think he smells my dinosaur at home!
The judge says I have to wear it for six months.
Sorry, can’t go. I’m under house arrest.
It's called cave arrest -- five years to life, his or mine.
Because I kept cutting off my ankle monitor.
At least he’s housebroken.
On the plus side, at least he's cavebroken.
My wife's idea to reduce my roaming charges.
Attempts at domestication have proven disappointing.
It's okay, his bark is worse than his bite.
He says I taste like chicken.
I've always wanted a pet, and I think he's attached to me too.
its the latest thing in home security , it just needs some fine tuning
I was hoping for a pet who's a little less needy.
Don't worry - he's just pulling my leg!
Herb's last words were: 'I thought he was an herbivore!'
Robert wanted a sabre tooth, but I said I needed a pet that wouldn't climb on the furniture.
I hate it when he gets affectionate and hungry at the same time.
So then my probation officer says, "Ankle, ankylosaurus, what's the big deal? A bracelet's a bracelet."
The weird part is that it’s actually a bird.
On the plus side, he leaves the furniture alone.
It's only until my parole hearing. And it beats going to prison.
The arc of domestication is long, but it bends toward frisbees.
I'm under house-confinement till my court date.
We've been working on 'fetch'!
I'll either train him or let him go extinct.
Apparently it's called separation anxiety.
Lately, everyone wants a piece of me.....
Someday we'll all look back at this and laugh.
Cave arrest is a bitch
'I'll tell yah what's been eating me..."
I don't agree that his bark is worst than his bite.
Home-schooling isn't working out as I hoped.
Just a bad case of separation anxiety.
They put me under house arrest until June, 86 BC.
It'll take a million years to train him.
I believe it's an anklemonitorsaurus.
I got the cast off this week, but the doc gave me one more week of experimental animal therapy. He's supposed to help keep the bones in place and provide companionship!
I hate being under house arrest and wearing a monitor.
It's part of the bail agreement.
It costs an arm and a leg to get out.
It's OK. I'm in the catch and release program.
For some reason, my belief in that whole herbivore theory is painfully diminishing...
Coming in for a bite?
Apparently somebody used his brother make my shoes.
I have to wear this Remnick ankle monitor because I broke the Cartoon Caption Rules.
Well obedience school was a bust.
I think I’ll call it ankle-o-sore-us.
Would you mind taking him off my legs for a few hours?
Well, you guys wouldn't let me get a tattoo.
Eventually, he’ll evolve and become an albatross around my neck.
This won't be so cute when it grows up.
I thought the ankylosaurus had gone extinct
He's still learning how to heel.
It comes off after thirty days of house arrest.
Well, it looked like a puppy when I bought it.
He doesn't like it when I use the word 'extinct'.
They say I'm a flight risk.
He hasn’t learned to heel yet but he’s getting close.
I'm on parole.
Everything was going fine until I forgot the safe word .
He can beg and roll over. We're still working on fetch.
Oh, I get the monitor off as soon as they resolve a little tax issue.
We start obedience school tomorrow.
Mom, Dad…don’t be so closed-minded. Dating bi-pedals is so the paleolithic era.
The breeder said he was an herbivore, but I am beginning to have my doubts.
I’m under house arrest for 12 months.
I said I'd give my right arm
mom. dad, it's not what it looks like- it's consensual and we have a safe word.
House arrest is a lot less lonely with my new monitor.
They say their mouths are cleaner than ours, so I’ll probably be fine.
Being under house arrest isn't so bad, but man! the ankle bracelet is killing me!
Mr. and Mrs. Rock I will need to keep him another week, we are on the verge of a major breakthrough.
It's time for me to move out; I'm feeling trapped.
I'm teaching it how to heel.
I’m under cave arrest until the trial.
They call it a pet.
I didn't realize how attached he would become to me.
You know, maybe wolves ARE a better choice!
Make him smile and I'll run for it
In a minute, I am not going to have a leg to stand on.
I got a deal. The other breed cost an arm and a leg.
Please don't say "I told you so."
Believe me, he's great with children.
I got him at the shelter. They said we were certain to bond.
Sorry I can't I'am under house arrest.
The previous tenant is having a hard time letting go.
They ran out of electronic ankle bracelets at the courthouse.
He followed me home! Can we keep him?
It's not like YOUR marriage is perfect.
First the roach problem, now this.
It's hard some days, but co-evolution takes work.
Her vet says it's separation anxiety, but my psychiatrist says it's a corporeal manifestation of my own self loathing.
He lost his rawhide.
The judge ordered cave arrest with an ankle monitor in lieu of bail.
But your sign says you welcome all emotional support animals!
Relax, it's only a gumosaurus.
I should have opted for the jail time.
He's a great pet but we have a ways to go with the training
Me? Worried? Oh no. He'll be extinct before long.
I know home confinement sounds preferable to prison, but this ankle monitor is a real pain.
How could any of us have seen this coming, given the one set of eyes between us
I got another DUI and I’m under House arrest.
They told me they could remove it, but my premiums would triple.
Apparently not quite extinct
Remember, 'there are no bad dinosaurs'.
I bought it yesterday and it is already getting attached to me.
Don't be afraid. He's just teething.
Yes, he's an anachronism. But I'm attached to him.
Gnaw, it doesn't hurt.
No, you don't get used to it. You never get used to it.
"I've been placed under 'Cave Arrest'".
It's new. Apparently I'm under cave arrest for drawing on the walls.
He obviously likes you. you should keep him.
Maybe we shouldn't get a watch-pet until after the leash is invented.
Training hasn't been easy but attachment has been a snap
I call it the shoe. Still needs some work.
It’ll be great when we get over the teething phase.
Mom and Dad, he followed me home. Can I keep him?
Hey, Bill, can I borrow your club again?
I guess I shouldn't have called him extinct.
And I said to him, 'Bite me.'
The cave comes with a home alarm system.
It's my ankle monitor so I don't skip town.
It's an Ankylosaurus.
But this behavior should stop as it evolves into a cat.
La Brea Tar Pit Rescue.
His bark is worse?
I'm hoping if I ignore it, it will go away on its own.
The pet shop owner insisted it wouldn't cost and arm AND a leg to feed him.
It's just until the trial.
Before you ask, it's cave arrest.
I should have known better. Achaenodons can be so possessive.
We can't do anything about it because it is a future endangered species.
They are making me wear him until the trial to make sure I don't skip bail.
We should get a new best friend.
He caught me painting on the walls.
Spike's evolved into a real problem
Do you mind if Cleo comes along?
So that’s a meat eater.
I think Timmy fell in the tar pit again.
It’s called home incarceration. If I try to leave the cave, the authorities are alerted by seeing what’s left of me.
I'm thinking in a few millennia this will be funny.
He has a serious attachment disorder.
He's got separation anxiety.
It was cute when he was little.
You put your right foot in Then take your right foot out  Put your right foot in Then you shake it all about You do the hokey pokey And you turn yourself around That's what it's all about
He is just suppose to move around the cave and clean the floor.
The anxiety medication is working....you should have seen him a few weeks ago.
Can I keep him Ma?
I always wanted a pair of crocodile shoes.
The worst part of cave arrest is that the ankle bracelet tends to drool.
I'm not allowed to leave the cave until the trial.
What do you mean you lost the access code?
It might have been a mistake to use a bone when I tought him to play fetch.
Don't paint this on the walls. Please.
Poor little guy is still teething
Sorry I can't go out hunting and gathering. I'm under cave arrest.
It's only teething.
It only hurts if I walk.
Cave arrest. That's what they called it.
Parking Enforcement said I can get him remove if I pay all of my outstanding fines.
My probation officer says it’s only for 30 days.
If I had two eyes I would have seen this coming.
I stole a wheel. They claim I'm a flight risk.
He keeps me grounded.
You get used to it.
In a million years, he'll be man's best friend.
Does this count as unwanted attention?
Thank god it’s a vegetarian!
I don't think this is my cave.
Oh...just trying to drain the swamp.
My doctor wrote a note so she's a therapy animal.
Oh that? I am under house arrest.
He's never done that before.

This is the last time we take in a rescue.
I think I’ll call him spot.
I have to pay a few outstanding parking tickets.
It's an ankle brachiosaurus. I'll have to wear it until my hearing.
My therapist calls it an attachment disorder.
They say they will be more manageable once they evolve into dogs.
I wanted a pair of crocs, but I could only find the one.
Every shirt comes with one of these.
I know you don’t understand, but I feel so trapped.
Sorry, I can't go. I'm under house arrest.
We're working through his separation anxiety.
This may not be the best species for domestication.
I'm going to wait till it becomes extinct.
Hey may be a bit rough now, but the next evolution will be domesticated.
I didn’t get time, just cave arrest.
Not only did he cost me an armadillo and a leg, he also has a fowl mouth.
Don't worry, I just called Dinosaur Control.
That's why he's called an Ankylosaurus.
If I tamper with this ankle monitor, it cuts ME off.
They make great pets but this one is too attached to me.
He lets go when I'm no longer under house arrest.
He's my court-ordered ankle monitor
As a matter of fact, yes, I am in favor of parole overhaul.
It was love at first bite.
Sorry, my ankle monitor will bite if I leave the cave.

No clubs for me tonight, I'm still on cave arrest.
Oy - you think you’ve got saurus?
Baby dinosaurs are so needy.
That's why the rent is so low.
It was this or 200 hours of community service.
He’s my emotional support animal
He's a rescue, his last three owners just disappeared.
It's a nice place but the security system could use some tweaking.
Don't worry, he's friendly.
The breeder swore he was vegan.
He's attached.
I was paroled on the condition I wear this ankle monitor.
The guy that sold him to me insisted that he was a herbivore.
At least he's not humping your leg.
...we're working on separation issues.
... And then the judge sentenced me to house arrest
Yep. He ain't a herbivore.
The judge granted me home detention.
He's just teething.
I love my new place, but the security system is so Cretaceous.
I don't mind the 6 month cave arrest sentence but this ankle bracelet is killing me!
We hope to have him trained before he's extinct.
I put him on a Paleo diet.
I told you the ankylosaurus wasn't extinct.
It comes with a state-of-the-art security system.

Don't worry, he's friendly.
When my parole officer said it should come off in a day or two, I hope he wasn't referring to my foot.
And to top it all off, his species has been extinct for 50 million years.
He just wants me to take him for a walk.
This tends to happen with the Terrierosaurs, but they can also be very cuddly and loyal.
Is it okay if we order in tonight?
It was love at first bite.
His bite's worse.
She doesn't like it when I criticize Hillary.
We're heading to obedience school!
Can't go today, but I might get free by Monday.
We were gonna name it "Spike",but we settled on "Fang"
I didn't choose him. He chose me!
Yes, there is a low incidence of dinosaur attacks in this neighborhood but the walls are real granite. That's unheard of in your price range.
I'm very attached to him.
We renamed him Oxymoron when we moved into a pet-friendly building.
It's separation anxiety, but throw a stick and he gets right over it.
We have been to 6 veterinarians and the only thing they can all agree on is that, whatever it is, it appears to be teething.
It's just until my trial date next week.
I am not looking him, I am not acknowledging him. I am the alpha.
It feels like he has been hanging around since the dawn of time.
Its a monitor lizard. I have to wear it for a year.

Now I know how Paul Manafort feels.
I’m on cave arrest until the first of the month.
Does this make me look guilty?
They don't shed and they are not aggressive, maybe slightly territorial but not aggressive.
The trick is to just ignore him
Don't worry, it's just a love bite.
He has abandonment issues.
Luckily he likes to follow me everywhere.
It’s my own fault. They said at the shelter that he was an ankle biter.
Please remind the homeowners association that federal laws allow persons with certain special needs to keep a comfort animal in a condominium despite a "no pets" provision.
He just wants to play.
He just can't get enough of me.
Sorry I can't go with you but I'm being pulled in another direction.
Her transition to the diet stuff isn’t going well.
I'm under house-arex.
When you invited us over to see your new ankle-biter, we assumed you had a new baby.

Sorry, I can't go anywhere without my Ankle Monitor Lizard.

I already told him this is an anachronism. He won’t listen.
I like to tell people that he rescued me.
I think it is just a reaction to the new vegan diet we are trying.
House arrest is tolerable but the ankle bracelet is a little tight.
Sorry, can't go. I'm under cave arrest.
I have to wear it the whole time I'm on house arrest.
I'm afraid I can't join you. I'm presently under cave arrest.
The ankle bracelet is annoying, but it's better than jail.
I said we should get a hamster, but you two just had to have a stegosaurus...
She's nice, but a little clingy.
I think I invented the Croc!
Don't worry, his foot in mouth disease is not contagious.
He's cave-trained, but we're still working on fetch.
Damn,I thought we could domesticate these
It's an Ankle-sore-us.
He was a rescue, so he's clingy.
Your home security system is a bit primitive, no?
But I can’t give her up! I already bought a bumper sticker that says 'Who rescued who?'
My probation officer calls it an 'ankle monitor.'
It’s his name on the lease.
Normally very friendly, but suffers from separation anxiety.
It's comes with being under house arrest.
It's an ankle monitor lizard.
He tends to be a little clingy.
So yeah, I’m under house arrest for the foreseeable future.
If it doesn't go extinct in a few days I'll have it checked.
Apparently my wheel has already been towed,so they placed a boot on me instead.
Judge says I have to keep this on till next the hearing
Judge says I have to keep this on till the next hearing
I shouted "Lacoste!" when I saw him, but he must have heard "Accost!"
Yeah, that totally bites.
...and then I yelled "DAAUGH!" and the name just kind of stuck.
We've been working on the "Fetch" command.
It's Called A Shoe.
I don't mind the house arrest, but the ankle monitor is a real drag.

I can't wait for dogs to be invented.
do you think our fossils will be found together?
Do you think next time we can just get grandma to babysit?
He hasn’t learned to heel yet but he’s getting close.
It's my own fault for having him declawed.
No, no. I'm his pet.
I taught him not to bite the hand that feeds him.
He's a rescue.
We have attachment issues.
My lawyer said I should be thankful to be placed on cave-arrest.
I named him myankylsaurous.
My lawyer did great, only 18 months with this monitor.
Excuse me. It's time to feed my mother-in-law.
He followed me home, can I keep him????
Yes, he is quite attached to me.
Truth be told, I’m having a little separation anxiety.
Don't worry, he is a softy. Ignore him for 5 minutes and he will crawl in your lap.
I know it's our night out, but can we reschedule? She's feeling really clingy.
I ran out of treats.
They're out of ankle bracelets.
That’s right. The ankle monitor limits me to a twelve foot perimeter around the cave. It just knows.
The good news is he doesn't bite other people.
He’s a real drag.
I think he's up to date on all his shots
It's a type of lizard. The judge called it an ankle monitor.
It's domestication--the next giant step for Man.
Read the fine print. These time shares always have a catch.
I got off pretty easy with just cave arrest.
The judge let me off with six months of cave arrest.
Can we keep him, please? He won't eat much.
If you have to ask, it's an ankle monitor until my trial date.
We've become quite attached.
As you can see, we still have some extinction issues.
. . . And he's already learned to fetch!
Hang in there. It will be extinct soon.
It started as a friendly game of Rock,Paper, Scissors!
It hurts a little more on the inside.
Thank God your home, Rex is locked and I forgot the password.
'Ankle monitors are not as discreet as people think.'
So, what did you get from the divorce?
He caught on right away. Next, I'm training him to fetch.
I'm teaching Fido how to floss.
He’s having separation anxiety, so we’re having salad tonight,
The judge required a house arrest ankle bracelet.
It's a proof of concept
I'd love to hunt and gather, but I'm under cave arrest.
She does this when she wants a bone.
He doesn't like leashes so we compromised.
I’ve grown accustomed to her jaws.
I think she misunderstood when I said, "How cute would it be if we had our own ankle-biter?"
No, no, it's fine; he just has separation anxiety.
"Go on ahead - I'll join you after I exfoliate a bit more......
It looked smaller in the store
This home security system is not working for me.
I thought house arrest would be the worst part.
It was a rescue.
I didn't pay my jaywalking tickets so they booted me.
Uncomfortable? Yes, but this will evolve into alligator shoes.

Why don't you girls just go ahead without me
Court-ordered till my trial for stealing the wheel.
Let it suffice to say that I'm in excruciating pain - which accounts for the screaming you were able to hear from across the plateau. Now, if one of you would kindly retrieve my club, it would go a long way toward solving both our problems.

I can't go: I'm on house arrest.

I have to wear it until my next hearing in 2 weeks.
He's got separation issues
Do you think the ankle bracelet too much?
He's a stegosoreankle.
I'm training him to come to heel.
It's a GPS ankle monitor. I got lucky - due to underfunding and overcrowding in our dungeon system, I was given cave arrest...

He'll be with me through the appeal.
He's very possessive.
It was either that or a nose ring.
He is not that great now, but could evolve.
But Ma, it followed me home!
She's a real man eater.
Crocs seemed like a good idea two years ago.
Apparently, it's on the Paleo Diet.
Yes it hurts, but with my Emotional Support Animal, there are so many perks and no one will sit next to me on the village transport cart.
Do you like my new ankle bracelet? It's from Lacoste
They were out of the small size ankle monitor.
He gets clingy around strangers

Papyrus, rock, scissors.
Sorry, can't party. House arrest
All I said was"Heel, Spike"!
His bite is bigger than his bark.
Truthfully, it's the stigma of being under cave arrest that stings the most.
Truth be told--this new field of animal domestication is somewhat 'trial and error'.
I'm feeling really vulnerable these days.
I still don’t know why you got this thing; you have nothing to steal.
Yes, it hurts. But it's the latest in fashion.
I think I figured out its mating call
He's very possessive of anything that looks like food.
Enough with the wheel -- invent obedience training!
Yep. He's a pedigreed ankylosaurus.
The vet says it's a bad case of separation anxiety.
Feeding him is costing an arm and a leg.

It's a wheel lock. I'm grounded for a week.
I thought you were just pulling my leg
They went easy on me -- I'm only under house arrest.
The ball and chain is staying home tonight.
My lawyer got me in-house probation.
30 days - I’m feeling lucky it was just the leg bracelet.
He's been quite needy since I lost his stick.
My doctor said it would help with shin splints
I have to wear it until the Grand Jury.
This cave arrest ankle bracelet really sucks.
It's part of my early release agreement.
Maybe 'heal' isn't the best command word.
I have this knowing feeling someone's pulling my leg.
It’s the latest in ankle monitors
We've become attached.
And, I have to do 200 hours of community service.
Don't worry he only bites.
Let us just say he caught me by surprise.
And people think monkeys on their backs are bad...
Only 59 more days of house arrest, then I get the ankle bracelet off.
So this is what home arrest is like
Don't worry, he's just trying to be friendly!
Ankle bracelets - the next big thing!
It slows you down a bit, but animal anklets are going to be huge this spring!
My lawyer says I am lucky to be under house arrest.
That guy Plato never mentioned there'd be alligators in the cave.
Stop debating --yank the tail !
Thank you for listening to my cave security system proposal, and I hope you'll consider investing.
Inter-specifically speaking, I think we should hold out for a better best friend.
Well then there you have it. You can afford to be judgmental.
Steg likes leg.
He's become quite attached ever since I brought him home from the shelter.
He's a rescue. The former owners disappeared without a trace. By the way, have you seen my wife lately?
Even though this is an anachronism, it's still hurting.
I look forward to a day when insects are smaller.
You warned me Lisa. The ones from the Aardvark pound have issues.
He’ll be with me until I pay my student loan.
I'm more of a cat person.
Stop staring! You'll flare up his social anxiety.
Yeah, I know, but I have a bigger button.
He only bites the one he loves.
They promised me my money back if he's not domesticated in 2,000 years.
The judge added him to my cave arrest.
They hate to be left alone.
My emotional support animal is filled with rage.
He is a very loyal pet at least.
Technically, we're compliant with the leash law.
I’m hoping it’ll be extinct in the next few days.
Separation anxiety. We're still working on letting go.
He just acts like any other puppy.
Misplaced affection.
Don't worry: when she's really mad, she bites my head off.
Don't worry, it will eventually die-off
This evolution stuff is a bunch of crock. Next thing you know they'll be talking about a ball and chain.
How does it notify the police?
The vet said that she has abandonment issues.
He's not fully domesticated yet.
I will tell you the key to life if you tell me how to get rid of hemorrhoids.
His therapist says it's a phase.
Grund kiss Girma. Grooga get mad. Made Grund put on ankle monitor.
This house arrest thing is a crock!
He gets a bit feisty after 5pm.
Please don't tell me you guys haven't heard of 9-1-1.
He comes with the unit, but he won't cost you an arm, and a leg to maintain.
At least I get to serve my time at home
My release was conditioned on paying bail and submitting to cave arrest.
To be on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown.
Can I keep him? He followed me home.
Seriously?? I'm dragging this thing around and still managed to get here on time!
The white House sent him to keep me from tweeting
Yeah, the bracelet's a little uncomfortable, but it beats doing time in the slammer.
Dinner!
Before there were Pit Bulls to bring into our homes.
But he followed me home........
Lovable, but he always has to stick his mouth on my foot.
It’s just until the trial’s over, they’re putting me under cave arrest.
The trick is not minding.
They call it inter-species attachment disorder.
He's NOT just in it for the food. My pet loves me!
Look what followed me home. Can I keep it?
You ought to see him fetch.
I didn't have a leash.
It’s the latest in cave-arrest technology.
it's court ordered
Thank goodness he's an herbivore!
Let's go... haven't you seen an ankle monitor before.
Ask your doctor if Canklesaurus is right for you.
Ignore the fleas. They're terrible this time of year.
We can’t figure out what she likes to eat.
... and some cavemen still say I'm not a victim of reptile harassment !
The Special Counsel has me under cave arrest.
He's jealous of other people.
I'm ordered to wear it and stay here at home. Let's just say I shouldn't have been behind that wheel I invented the other night.
I hate homonyms. I told the guy at the store I wanted an ankle gaiter.
Well, at least he's cavebroken.
It's going to be O.K. You have one LEFT
It’s a new thing they call a house arrest ankle bracelet. Don’t ask.
We thought a rescue pet was the right way to go, but he has issues.
He came with the sublet.
He's taking me out for lunch.
They say if I wander too far from the cave, the anklet will issue a firm bite.
I must have misunderstood when you asked me over for dinner.
I'm going to court next week to get the ankle monitor off.
He seemed further away.
The Stegosaurus whisperer I'm not.
I think you may have invented alligator clamps
He seems to have gotten very attached to me.
Don't worry, he is a pet
It's time to invent kittens.
The judge gave me 6 months cave arrest for riding with intoxicated.
Me call it "plantiff's attorney".
How do you like my ankle bracelet?
I'm on house arrest after that bonfire fracas.
...On the bright side, he practically walks himself.
Ultimately, they gave me home detention.
It's nothing, you should have heard it bark
Hang on a minute. I'll have to feed him before I can go.
Her spike is worse than her bite.
Perhaps we should cross this one off the possible pets list.
...How do you say “Letgo my lego” in Danish?...
I traded my shells for this new money called Bitcoin
And he wouldn't have caught me if I had binocular vision.
And they wonder why they are going extinct.
I wanted a Labrador, but Lisa insisted on a non-shedding breed.
Trog says he's vegetarian but I'm not convinced.
I've got him thinking HE is taking ME for a walk.
Don't worry, Lizzie still only has her hatching teeth.
He's an ankylosaurus and yes, he's aptly named.
Maybe I should have brought the wolf home with me instead.
The parole board required it.
He thought we had similar hair styles
I knew it liked me, but i didn't know it was this attached.
The dinosaur whisperer suggested clubbing the bastard.
He's evolving nicely, but still has some separation anxiety.
I have to wear it as long as I'm under house arrest.
Fortunately, Rex is not a tyrannosaurus.
Would love to join, but I'm on cave arrest.
Son, we're putting you on cave arrest
Get out while you can--his bark is worse than his bite!
This new ‘cave-arrest’ prototype is very aggressive.
It seems as if his separation anxiety is getting worse.
And I also had to surrender my passport.
I guess we can keep him.
I forgot the password for the security system.
He wants to take me home.
He’s getting pretty attached.
Look, it's really no big deal, just 4 more months and I am off of house arrest, and this monitoring bracelet is off for good.
Thanks for visiting. It's called an "Anklasaurus". After the trial, Judge Cromagnon gave me the choice of this or voting for Trump.
How did you get on cave arrest this time Billy?
He's got a few attachment issues.
They'll remove it when I'm off probation.
And it comes in a clutch as well.
They haven't invented the ball and chain yet.
I’ll pass on our lumch date today, girls. This one’s got separation anxiety.
It's this new fad called an ankle bracelet.
Sorry I won't be joining you, I'm under cave arrest.
House arrest gnaws on you after awhile.
It's a newish relationship, sure, but I already feel committed.
I’m naming him ballanchain.
It's not a pet in the strict sense
I got off easy. They only put me on cave arrest after I vandalized the walls.
I can't go, I'm afraid. I'm under house arrest.
It's not so much what he says, it's how he says it.
I asked him if he felt like having a shindig. What a crock of shit!
I caught a blergl for supper! However I’m going to need some help getting him into a stewpot!
He's grown attached to me.
It only hurts when you laugh.
He's too evolved to actually eat me.
It's still got some kinks to work out, but I have a feeling that pets are going to be a big thing in the future!
I'm really looking forward to the invention of long pants.
Maybe this doesn't seem like a healthy relationship to you, but you don't know him like I do.
He’s been extra needy ever since he accidentally ate Shirley.
Well, it did warn us what would happen if we did the Chicken Dance one more time.
Don't worry, Spiky is very friendly.
He's a nice pet and he really doesn't eat much.
When we discover iron we'll make a better trap.
We're out of sticks now that fire is a thing.
He followed me home. Can I keep him, please, please?
Yes, I am feeling a bit slow today. Why do you ask?
I have to wear this until I make bail.
He's a rescue from the tar pits.
He followed me home, so I must keep him.
We used to be joined at the hip, but now he does double-duty as an ankle weight.
At first I was happy the judge gave me house arrest ... but now, not so much.
I forgot the treats,"Heel, Rex!" doesn't work right without 'em.
Has he had his rabies vaccination?
It was an ankle bracelet or jail time.
I had my eye on a champion bloodline T-Rex, but the Mrs. thought this little ankle-biter would be easier to manage inside.
Oh don't worry about her, she gets nervous around guests
Thou do not have the balls to enter.
I don't have coverage...
Get the Jaws of Life.
It is reported in the “Mesozoic Times” that these guys teethe for many years.
It came with the place at no charge. The previous owner just mysteriously disappeared.
The early days of House Arrest.
House arrest seemed like a good deal until I saw the ankle device.
Oh - they get very attached.
I'm working on domestication.
It's so I can't put my foot in my mouth anymore.
I know you told me not to get attatched...
Coexistence bites
It’s the latest fad!
She said she was an ankle biter so I swiped right...
The wife wanted a saber-toothed tiger, but I’m allergic
His mother abandoned him before he was hatched.
Tell me, have they invented pain killers yet?
Thanks for coming over. This house arrest is a real pain.
Jim says it’s just an attachment phase.
It’s a new thing called cave-arrest.
I'll hold it, you guys get the clubs...
Can we keep him?
The judge said it should come off in about six months.
He has attachment issue
#MeToo
I'll be frank with you, I find it to be nuisance.
It's a kind of love.
I dun' know ... separation anxiety?
You should see its mother.
It was court-ordered...the judge thought I was a fight-or-flight risk.
The judge called it house arrest.
We mustn't judge. If we were going extinct we'd hold on for dear life also!
That’s great that he comes when you call; but I think he’s still attached to me.
i guess my letter carrying training is complete.
He's so affectionate.
Yes it's painful. But it's the only way I can get him to go out for a walk.
He's adamant that I accept our co-existence.
Do I look fat with this creature latched onto my leg?
It’s my PO’s idea!
I love him. He's cave-broken but he gnaws everything.
I'd love to go but I'm still under house arrest.
This has been my longest relationship and honestly, I think there’s potential...
I love him dearly, but he may need a few more obedience classes.
He'll grow out of it. He thinks he's a crocodile.
We should probably switch back to the high protein mix.
The judge says I'm a flight risk
I got the other one off, but ran out of dental floss.
Remember when I said that depth perception is overrated? Well...
He must have heard us talking about tax shelters. Now he just won't let go.
That's why I call him 'Draggin'.
The judge thinks I'm a flight risk.
Domesticating the wolf was easy so I thought I'd go for more of a challenge.
The current tenant will be not be an issue.

Amazon delivered it from the Amazon and now I can't return it.
I'm under house arrest till the third moon of 620
Actually, she's quite tame.
Mom and Dad, meet the old ball and chain!
My new home security device needs just a little tweaking.
If I survive teething he should make for a good pet!
There’s no such thing as a bad stegosaurus, just a bad owner.
All the pet adoption agency had was him or a T-Rex. This made sense at the time.
It’s my new live ankle bracelet.
I figured it was too obvious to be a real trap!
Thanks for coming to visit while I'm under house arrest.
"Hi! What's your names?" CHOMP, CHOMP. (from Adam, 7 years old) "Why do our faces have to look like tasty chickens?" (From Alana, 10 years old)
Sorry, I have to cancel our plans. His separation anxiety is worse than I thought.
They said they ran out of ball and chains.
I lost the remote.
I didn't understand when the breeder said it could get attached to me.

They determined I was a flight risk.
The vet says he's just teething.
I called him an anachronism.
I have to wear him as part of my work release.
The only time I'm aware of the ankle monitor is when he gnaws at feeding time.
It hurts at first but eventually you get used to it.
My wife wanted a ferret and I wanted a T Rex. We compromised.
Thank God, they are still his puppy teeth.
She's ready for dinner
Meet my service stegosaurus.
If we spin this correctly, this could turn into a footwear brand.
These critters only eat BLT's. Bacon, legs and tomato.
I told her my parents wanted me to find someone interested in my mind. She promised she'd get there.
It’s called the Manafort ankle bracelet because history is going to repeat itself.
It's nothing, really. His bark is worse than his bite!
I think it likes me.
This doesn't even introduce a coup de grace to our bond.
Its OK - I just got house arrest
It's this daily grind that gets to me.
Fine, I concede that this idea of having a 'pet' at home might be a couple of hundred thousand years early.
I keep hoping we'll evolve past this paradigm.
My wife's idea of an emotional support animal.
I had a gnawing need for a pet.
He's cute, but has some attachment issues.
It's only for another six months. After that I get my lending privileges back.
Please let me keep him. He’s very attached to me.
Gotta to keep this thing on my ankle 'til I'm off cave arrest.

Can you believe it? I get booted for walking 5mph in a 2mph zone.
He's become attached to me.
Yeah, just eight more weeks of cave-arrest.
I forgot you had a Chihuahuasaurus...does he like to play fetch?
It's been like this since I brought him home from the Shelter
As Neanderthals we must strictly hew to our policy of passive resistance.
The judge said I was lucky just to get away with a tracker
Yes, it's an ankle monitor. I'm under cave arrest.
I'll take him out to play Fetch somewhere—I'm thinking over by La Brea.
And that's why it's called a "MyLegIsSore-aus"
Yes it hurts, but "cave arrest" still beats the alternative
He's my new teacup Stegosaurus.
It's just while I'm on parole.
He's not like me. He's a leg man.
"Fish oil will do wonder for your skin," they said. "Trust us," they said.
I tried to turn him into a vegetarian. It’s his revenge.
Heel is his favorite command.
Now that we've visited the petting zoo, anyone up for the 3-legged race?
I thought it was excema at first.
House arrest is bad enough, but this ankle device has a real mean streak.
How do you like our new security system?
I'm not sure who is domesticating who?
He gets bad separation anxiety
I’d go but I’m on house arrest
I think my pre-Achilles tendinitis is acting up.
Who needs Obamacare, am I right?
I'm under home confinement until the trial and have to wear the ankle shackle.
After I serve my one year probation they'll remove the ankle bracelet.
I do not think we will see him anymore for Grog drew the short straw and his anklet monitor was a T-Rex.
I’m on house arrest. Judge’s order.
I can't really leave, but I've dropped like 20 fire tapes.
By guesses as to how opposable thumbs might get me out of this one?

My Wife doesn't think they can be domesticated so I'm going to try a wolf pup.
It’s an ankle monitor for rolling a wheel under the influence.
Your telling me that dinosaurs have been extinct for millions of years is not helping my situation.
Have you seen my wife?
Yes, normally I would get an Uber.
We're working on his attachment issues.
It was either wear the ankle monitor, or jail....
It's really hard to train a baby Stegosaurus.
I'm afraid I can't join you today, my dear little pet suffers from separation anxiety.
anyway , we were playing ,you put your right foot in ...
My wife placed me under cave arrest until she gets back from her mother's next week.
Ok, sometimes he bites
No biggie--he's just teething.
He gets very anxious and possessive every morning when he hears the garage door open
"His bark is worse than his bite", I just thought of it
Oh, it's you...I thought I was seeing double from the pain...
It's not house arrest or even the ankle cuff that bothers me as much as it is the saliva.
he's always been a leg man
I think he's really starting to like me.
What's the name of your dog?
I know, he's just an ankle biter, but I caved in.
George stepped in the trap again.
yes, he thinks he runs the cave.
He's afraid I'll go extinct.

Cave arrest for three months, but I can lose the Ankylosaurus in two.
I think I need a bandaid.
He can't bear the thought we won't be fossilized together.
They call it a scram bracelet.
I'm not saying he's trained. I'm not saying he's friendly. But you'll never find a baby Dacentrurus with more potential.
It's not as bad as a tiger by the tail
The trouble with any of these BNBs is the pets you have to put up with.
I broke up with her gently, but she's having a hard time letting go.
Very possessive, but got rid of my husband..I will let you borrow her if you like.
I hear 2.0 has facial recognition
HR just said, 'Boys will be boys!' and that there's nothing they can do about it.

Invention of the leash
I think I will call him "Ankle-o-sore-us."
We really do need to build a better mousetrap.
He's always so happy to see me when I get home..
Ah, but you see "Komodo Dragon" is all the rage for the Spring Collections!
Dino unfortunately has developed a mild case of 'separation anxiety'.
He suffers from a bit of separation anxiety.
I can't wait until this species becomes extinct.
Obviously, he’s a rescue.
I wish someone would invent "Fetch!"

He's very anti-social. He does this everytime I have company over.
We thought he’d leave after eating the furniture.
Can I keep him? He followed me home.
I hereby call to order this emergency meeting of the Domestication Club.
He's only partially cave trained.

It's called prehistoric love.
No, he's misunderstood.
The guy said it would improve home security.
The Judge says I have to wear this ankle bracelet for three more weeks
On sale at Petcave.
When you said I'd become attached to the place...
Thanks for bringing him home officer

One of my parole restrictions.
It's early days, but we are still working on who  is the predator and who is lunch.
I keep warning you! No depth perception is placing us all in danger!
When his baby teeth are gone that's it.
He's not quite cavebroken yet.
They gave me house arrest, but I'm aloud to visit the zoo.
The cops say if I try to take it off, I will go to jail.
You can tell by the way that he's biting my leg that he is an al-leg-gator.
We both suffer from separation anxiety.
Its the ankle bracelet I always wanted
Trust me, it's better than what he was doing to the other leg.
It's nothing a little ice can't take care of.
Is it any wonder why this breed is called legasaurus?

He's rethinking his vegetarian lifestyle.
Soon as newspaper is invented I am going to roll one up and let him have it!
I'm weaning him.

He’s a rescue. We think he was abandoned.
He's a great little mouser, but sometimes he goes for calves.

He has some separation anxiety.
He's still a little rough on the "heel" command.
These pure-breads can be a little temperamental.

Our relationship is evolving. I think he wants to be my best friend.
It's just the usual separation anxiety

He isn’t cave broken yet.
House arrest is not so bad, but the ankle bracelet is a little uncomfortable.
I want to keep him. He's really attached to me.

Not only that, but he roars if I leave my cave.
I have to wear him until my trial date on the next solstice.
I’m under house arrest until my court date.
Would you believe I just went out for a bite?
I shouldn’t have told him I was getting my own cave.
