In the `_cardinal` experiments, participants were asked to rate how funny a
caption was as "unfunny", "somewhat funny" or "funny".

In the `_dueling` experiments, participants were asked to choose between the
funniest of two captions.

Round 1 was released with about 6.7k captions. From this, 50 were selected.
With these 50, we created a two part round 2 experiment. We asked the user to

1. Rate how funny each one of the 50 captions were (unfunny, somewhat funny,
   funny)
2. Make unlimited pairwise comparisons.
