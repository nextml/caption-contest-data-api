3,1,0,Get it through your brain, Janice. We only have 3 handles!
5,0,0,This is heavy like Kim's nude selfie.
3,1,0,What could I say? He insists that he can dazzle the shareholders with how well he can play 'Stairway to Heaven' on his electric guitar
4,0,0,When they said this was a huge case, they sure weren't kidding!
5,1,0,I think they have taken the teamwork concept too far.
4,2,4,Wanna share a cab?
3,0,0,Up here in Winnipeg, we call it the "Hockey Stick" not "The Football"
6,1,1,I think today's the day I get promoted to front handle.
3,1,0,Don't you just love being a lobbyist for the funeral business?
5,0,0,So which one of us gets to play tonight?
4,1,0,What do you say we leave this one here in purgatory?
3,0,0,If you ask me, streamlining has really gotten out of control.
3,1,0,At all times, stay with the money
5,1,0,It's only problematic when checking in at airport security.
5,0,0,It means we're top brass.
4,0,0,Do you think we're taking this commute sharing thing a bit too far?
3,0,0,I mean, you can't blame her for staring.
3,1,0,Our only fault was asking the boss to work on the same case...
3,1,1,I think they've taken the whole "team building" thing too far this time.
3,2,0,This won't be brief.
3,0,0,Never, never wanna see what's in the box!
3,4,2,Try to remember to say 'xylophone', not 'secret nuclear device'.
3,1,0,Twenty-five years to settle the Fender estate.
4,0,0,It's capricious and arbitrary.
3,0,0,Actually, getting to carry "The Big Briefcase" is considered quite an honor!
3,1,1,You right wingers are on the wrong side of this case
3,0,0,Just wait until you see the executive washroom.
6,0,0,The Three-F-Case team in mild hysteria after another incredibly decent pitch.
2,2,0,This carpool elevator is greatly enhancing my commute.
6,0,1,By the way, Collins- welcome to the firm of Collins, Collins, and Collins.
3,1,1,Nobody will suspect we have hotel towels in here.

3,0,0,He told us he wanted to be buried just in case.
3,0,0,Looks like our ex-wife is on our again.
3,2,0,I don't care what the boss says, this Three Man Briefcase is a ridiculous idea!!!
4,1,0,Harvey, this is the last time I'm going to tell you. This case is for briefs, not long johns!
3,0,0,Maybe he is the CEO, but why can't we just cut his sandwiches in half?
3,0,0,We work for a cooperation firm.
3,1,0,He always wanted his ashes scattered near the boardroom.
3,2,0,I dread the day they get rid of the middle man.
3,0,1,I 'm tired of team building.
3,0,0,Our job-sharing arrangement has officially become weird.
3,1,0,I'm heading to the restroom. You too?
3,1,0,going our way?
3,0,0,In my dad's day, interns counted as half of a regular employee!

3,0,1,I've never been a pallbearer at a corporate funeral before.
3,0,0,H.R. takes team building to a new level.
3,0,0,We know you're not doing the heavy lifting around here.

3,2,1,Big case today.
3,1,0,This is a big case; don't be on the wrong side
3,0,0,We're all about teamwork, Johnson. Don't let us down.
4,3,2,When the boss said he wanted three of us on the case I didn’t think this is what he had in mind.
5,0,0,"Ben, I just want to say two words about the future....Are you listening to me?" "Telescopic Pointers!" (Pissy little take on The Graduate)
5,0,0,I'm the one who does all the heavy lifting!!
5,0,0,Let take it to the CFO he knows where all the bodies are buried.
5,0,0,Corporate might be taking this ride share thing a little too far.
3,0,0,Does it really take three of us to whack this guy?
3,0,0,Snitch
3,0,1,I suppose this has as good a chance as any of distracting from the leg shackles.
3,0,0,It was one thing when they put all three of is one cubicle and now this!
4,1,0,A team that carries a briefcase together, works well together.
3,0,1,I'm beginning to resent these long, drawn-out cases.
3,0,1,We may have taken the "speak softly and carry a big stick," metaphor a bit too literally.
3,0,0,We really are the only ones who know where the bodies are buried.
4,2,0,I told you the boss had big plans for us.
4,2,2,...then the bartender asks, 'Why the long case?
2,2,0,This has to be the worst team building exercise ever
3,0,0,Really, you ask for a table dance in the elevator?
4,1,0,You said you wanted to include the longitudinal study
3,0,0,Lighten up already.
3,0,1,I thought we each had our own when we got on the elevator.
3,0,0,This is what comes from exaggerating.
3,0,0,Kind of ironic that the boss still calls this a "brief"-case.
3,0,0,It may not be the briefest, but at least it gets the job done.
2,3,0,Just wait until the NRA sees this one!
3,0,0,I wish I could see the look on his face when he can't find the body.
4,1,0,I told you, we should've just done a power point presentation.
4,0,0,This sharing economy has gone too far.
5,1,0,What, you never heard of bringing up the middle?
4,0,0,I agreed to the carpool and the time-share vacation condo, but this is totally ridiculous!
6,2,0,Now we know why they bought that new printer. It prints eleven by infinity.
3,0,0,That's how we decided to go in the opposite direction of the paperless company.
3,1,0,It Is a pair of gloves. Trump insisted on this box.
5,1,0,I know, right? It's a new OSHA reg when moving a tripod.
3,1,0,Next time, I get to ride in the suitcase.
3,0,0,Saul over at Rossford Inc. tells me his company is just beginning THEIR merger.
2,2,0,Should we really be calling this a 'brief'case?
3,0,0,I'm ready for the training wheels to come off.
3,0,0,I think people are starting to get the wrong idea.
3,0,0,Job sharing sounded more glamorous in the interview.
1,2,0,I hope to make First Handle in five years.
3,0,0,There's a giraffe in there. Don't ask.
3,0,0,Once we get started just take your cue from us.
2,2,0,Technically, I would call it our long case.
3,1,0,Now, you're sure they insisted on the long-form contract?
3,0,0,I admire your positive thinking Alex, but "NO NO NO" does not mean "maybe."
3,0,0,Sadly that presentation died, but it will live on in all of us.
3,0,0,I heard there is a dead rabbit in the box. What do you think?
3,1,0,You're absolutely certain he said bedspread and not spreadsheet?
3,0,0,Do you ever feel like you're doing the work of three people?
3,0,0,A bicycle built for two made a lot more sense.
3,1,0,This is our best joint presentation yet.
3,0,0,Of course you matter. Look, Johnson will walk first into the next lift, and then you can have the front of the briefcase.
3,1,0,I think we’ve got this job-sharing thing all wrong.
3,1,0,When they ask if we want to extend our presentation, we will be prepared.
3,0,0,Another day at United Pallbearers.
3,0,0,I hope you don't have any vacation plans, Harris. This is gonna be a long case.
7,0,0,Do YOU want to tell the boss what happened to his pet boa constrictor?
4,1,0,Didn't I tell you? You saw the way the way that babe eyed us when she saw our cool partner briefcase.
3,0,0,We're representing is a real snake.
3,2,0,This time, I'll be Larry, he'll be Moe, and you can be Curly.
5,0,0,Tell I.T. to teach Burt how to set margins
3,0,0,Do you know whats in this case? Your looking very shady today.
3,0,0,Did you see that look on her face after I told her we work for ACME sex toys?
2,2,0,You don't seem to be on our side.
4,0,0,If they catch us climbing the corporate ladder from the top floor we'll be blackballed.
3,1,0,I'm holding up both ends.
3,0,0,I need to get out of middle management.
4,1,0,Did I tell you we're going on vacation next week?
3,0,0,Look again: The nose of the large head is the chin of the small head.
5,0,0,Isn't she our neighbor. I wonder what she's up to ?
3,1,0,They won't accept a Bank's check for their condo.
3,0,0,Because nobody wants to be left holding it.
3,0,0,However this thing unfolds in there, I want you to your end up.
3,0,0,I play the world's largest harmonica at this club after work.
5,0,0,Common planning time is a pain in the butt.
5,0,0,This will be brief. We've never lost a case.
4,0,0,Why, oh, why do they call them briefs?
3,0,0,I thought this was what he meant by a 3D presentation.
3,0,0,I had a feeling the new guy would be on the left...
3,1,0,We're anticipating a long trial.
3,0,0,Escalators and stairs are a bit more challenging.
3,0,0,Before I was in Cream, I had to carry it myself.
4,1,1,This performance is for the Trilateral Commission.
3,0,0,How long 'till you think ol' Bartleby's gonna start to smell?
4,0,0,Think they were impressed by the length of our presentation?
3,0,0,Our reading of the constitution is especially rigid.
3,0,0,By the way, we'll all have to leave at 3:15 today....I've got root canal work scheduled.
3,3,0,This is absolutely my biggest case so far!
3,1,0,I'm a very hands-on supervisor.
4,0,0,Trump-Mat
3,0,0,McMullen and I can handle this ourselves.
3,0,0,What a shame. He was only forty-five.
3,3,3,It's a merger case.
3,1,0,That's two down to one up!
2,2,0,I'd like to go back to just carpooling.
3,0,0,Psst! On 'three' we drop it, OK?
2,2,0,No- the worst part about downsizing is we only have one pen.
3,0,0,I think we've taken car pooling a little too far.
3,0,0,What do you plan to tell security?
3,0,0,The CEO urged the shareholders to carry-on.
5,0,0,Why do I always have to be in the middle?
4,0,0,Do we make our presentation using Trump's logic or Hillary's principles?
4,1,0,This is the left-handed floor.
4,1,0,I still think this is a strange team-building exercise.
3,1,0,Hearse is double-parked around the corner.
3,0,0,We bill in triplicate.
3,0,0,Since we are all dress alike, we are sure to land this new gig!
3,0,0,Does this briefcase make my hands look small?
3,0,0,It's not as if it's really heavy. It just makes management look like we work!
3,1,0,He lost a lot of weight.
3,0,0,Consider us as the three wise men reincarnated.
4,1,1,Welcome aboard! The company says all of this promotes teamwork, but revolving doors are still a real hot button issue with HR.
3,1,0,I really hope no one feels an irresistible urge to tell a light bulb joke.
5,0,0,Take this dead deal to the cemetery of the re-leased, re-poed, and retired.
3,1,0,Small price to pay for the iPhone 14.
3,0,0,Linda over there keeps complaining about how she makes 25% less than us.
3,0,0,Remember…tight on the left turns …and take it wide on the rights.
3,3,1,Wait. If you're here... who's in the briefcase?
3,1,0,I've never been a pallbearer for a bankruptcy before.
3,0,0,I think we carried it off well
3,0,0,Why'd she have to unload all her baggage on us?" "I know. I never even met the girl.
3,1,0,And that's how I made it to middle management.
4,0,0,Yeah I know Eames got hit by a bus but the company response is a bit extreme I think.
3,0,0,I am pulling my weight
3,0,0,Of course, size matters
3,0,0,If your playing Wagner, the contrabassoon player typically needs an extra set of lungs.
3,0,0,I draw the line at the bathroom door.jg
3,0,0,Smart phone and massage bed is all I carry with me!!!!
3,1,0,So this was the vise president's idea of collaboration!
2,2,0,One piece of advice on your first day... watch the corners.
3,0,0,No, this isn't the nuclear football. This briefcase is for the presidential steaks.
3,0,0,The rifle case lets them know that we mean business.
3,3,1,They said to bring a body of evidence.
3,0,0,Taking teamwork to a whole new level.
3,0,0,Of course it takes three of us: we all have small hands.
3,0,0,I'm afraid that this proposal is going to be D.O.A.
5,0,0,You're not carrying your load.
3,0,0,Boy, if she only knew we are "Super Glued" to these handles!
4,0,2,So, how exactly does brief case-pooling help the environment again?
7,0,0,The boss wants us to try out manager a trois, but I think it feels too much like three on a satchel. I've done that. It didn't end well.
3,0,0,I said Three on a Match not Three on a Latch
2,2,0,This merger has gone too far guys.
4,0,0,No, my part is way heavier than yours.
3,1,1,Good think we carpool.
5,1,0,OK, the first thing you need to know is that Ted was a leftie.
4,3,2,If anyone asks, you packed your own suitcase.
4,1,0,I get off on the third, Jack on the second. You can handle it from there.
3,1,0,We really need to get in the same carpool.
5,2,0,To be honest, when I signed up for the job-sharing program, I had a different arrangement in mind.
3,0,0,Trump's loudness keeps him small endowed .These back up body parts are becoming heavier and heavier
3,0,0,The first one who says "outside the box," we let him have it.
3,0,1,Just try to act like this is completely normal.
3,0,0,'Okay, three-briefing we go! if you're sure they didn't say 'de-briefing...'"
4,1,0,Next time, maybe don't be so quick to volunteer for the big case.
2,2,0,In retrospect, I don't think I fully understood what "making partner" entailed.
3,1,0,It's either a very large carrot or an average size stick.
2,2,0,I told her it was the gun legislation.
5,0,0,If you ask me, these commuter challenges are getting out of hand.
3,0,0,Right...right...right left right...
4,0,0,This time we pass by the men's room before the handcuffs, ok?
9,4,1,If he'd file his taxes online we wouldn't have to haul around this long form.
3,0,0,It's a proud office tradition, long board chess at lunchtime.
3,2,2,I thought legal pads were already too long.
3,2,1,One of these days, someone is bound to figure out we are playing croquet on the roof during lunch break.
3,1,0,Don't forget, you're the one steering this bad boy.
3,0,0,At our next meeting, I get to be coxswain.
3,1,1,First time with a big case?
3,1,0,Giving out happy endings again, Williams?
3,1,0,Come on, Rick. Be a team player.
5,0,0,Welcome to Three's Company.
4,1,0,We are definitely getting promoted, we landed the biggest case!
3,0,0,You think they'll agree to our terms?
3,0,0,We're taking advantage of the "carried interest" loophole.
3,3,0,Fred and I feel you're not carrying your share of the load.
4,0,2,I thought when the boss said "use bullets" -- he meant "bullet points"...
6,0,1,He brought in his personal water board from home.
3,1,0,You realize this makes you an accomplice, right?
3,0,0,We'll need a fourth partition once Jimmy signs the new lease.
4,0,0,Apparently, you found the key to the the portable tanning booth!
3,0,0,No, you have to stay at the back.
3,1,0,There's no 'I' in 'Team,' Tim.
3,0,0,I read they do this at Google
3,0,1,The flute paid the piper. This is his casket.
3,1,1,This is a long held secret.
2,2,0,I guess this is okay, but did we have to share that stall?
4,0,0,What do you suppose the boss wants with this organization chart?
2,2,0,In case you were wondering, you're in the back because you are the new guy.
3,2,1,This is my first really big case--I'm glad you two agreed to help out.
3,0,0,You think she noticed my new tie?
3,1,0,The corporate ladder was kept under lock and key.
4,0,0,We welcome diversity at Southpaw Corporation.
3,1,0,This being triplets thing is getting old!
3,0,0,This is carrying job sharing too far.
3,0,1,It's a much lighter load when the N.S.A., C.I.A. and F.B.I. work together.
3,0,0,I was working as a butcher before I became a magician.
3,0,0,These days you never know who your delivering a Hero to.
2,2,0,The partners didn't think I could handle this case by myself
3,2,2,Our coffee mug has three handles too.
3,0,0,I'm not saying I wouldn't vote for Romney. I just want him to decide before we have to bring up another damn binder.
4,0,1,If you ask me, Uber's briefcase sharing service leaves a lot to be desired.
3,0,0,Why am I always in the middle of everything?
5,0,0,I knew we'd find a way to carry this case forward.
6,0,1,So THAT'S where he got the hotdog for last month's caption contest!
3,0,0,Correct me in front of a client again and you're fired.
2,2,0,Don't blame me for deal falling through... I'm just the middleman.
2,2,0,How about we take up ping pong instead?
3,0,0,Our clients like us since we never dropped a case.
3,1,0,"Long arm of the law" my foot!
3,0,0,They're going to downsize. The middleman always gets it.
3,0,1,I guess you could say it's a big deal.
3,1,0,I blame the carpool culture.
3,0,0,This is not the 'brief threesome' that I thought it was.
3,0,0,Now I know how they're able to keep revising the previous month's new job figures upwards.
3,1,1,Sharing files was easier at my last job.
6,0,0,Are you sure this is what they meant by 'meeting with the brass?'
3,0,0,We've been separated! Why do we still use this conjoined triplets briefcase?
3,0,0,I don't know why he can't the interns to shred his emails.
4,1,1,Run over. By a steam roller. Easiest pallbearer gig I've ever had.
3,0,1,I hope the sub isn't too soggy from the mayo.
2,2,0,Don't go all "Rosa Parks" on us Lester. It's strictly a coincidence.
3,1,0,Hey, do you know what we have in here? My arm is getting tired.
3,1,0,Is this really synergy?
4,1,0,I'm not sure that "brief" is exactly the right word.
4,2,0,Do you guys think we've been carpooling too long?
3,0,0,Work pressure will do that
3,1,1,As long as we're outside the suitcase, I figure we must be doing something right.
3,1,0,You guys know this is MY saxophone, right?
3,0,0,Did anyone notice he's missing?
3,2,0,I hope they don't cut out the middle man.
4,0,0,We all carry our weight around here.
3,1,1,If we can just get past the xylophone detector, we'll be home free.
4,0,0,this working as a 'trio' really sucks
3,0,0,Don't let her get under your skin.
3,1,0,This is one heavy race card.
3,0,1,As an accountant I shouldn’t say this, but the 1040 long form is getting to be ridiculous.
3,0,0,I hate being the bearer of bad news.
3,0,0,"Why on earth should a flat-pack casket be any creepier?
3,0,0,A team effort! It's a team effort. That's all I friggin hear.
4,0,0,This was supposed to be a job for one-handed couriers.
3,0,0,This new "power team" approach is getting out of hand.
3,0,0,If I go down, you guys are coming with me.
3,0,1,I"m so relieved we're TSA Three-Check?
3,1,0,Isn't job-sharing awesome?
3,0,0,This partnership thing is over done.
4,2,0,Whose side on you on?
3,0,0,I've got the blueprints in the case. I think they'll be impressed!
4,0,0,Briefing papers
3,0,0,I hope the bassoon wasn't a mistake.
3,3,1,Makes them feel better about our $2,000 per hour consulting fee.
4,0,0,This is a very big case
3,0,0,If you stop looking at me like that, maybe she won’t realize it’s a corpse.
8,3,0,Isn't it your turn to be the middleman?
3,1,0,I really appreciated your support in there.
3,0,0,Your 'brief ' is heavier than I thought.
4,0,0,Hey, Mac, this long, oblong box is heavy ! We're C.I.A. case officers, supposedly on a routine courier run? What's in the box: a body? I mean, is the Company delivering like U.P.S. now, as mortuary pall-bearers C.O.D.?
5,0,1,Does she realize this is all of her paperwork?
3,1,0,Why does he always get to be up front?
3,1,0,How come I always get the torso and you get the feet?
3,0,0,This "share your briefcase" rage will prove to be a fad.
3,1,0,Assisted living works for my mother.
3,0,0,Don't offer to eliminate the middleman!
3,1,0,This is gonna be a long meeting.
3,0,0,I'd say we've tripled our productivity.
4,0,0,Stan, this is the last time I will carry your stupid longjohns.
3,0,0,Corporate downsizing meetings give me the willies.
5,0,0,Even the best lawsuits must end.
3,0,0,Inefficient? It used to take 6 men to move Pallbearer Bonds.
4,0,0,Hope this damn Human Centipede sequel contract gets signed today.
3,1,0,This is my other smartphone.
3,0,0,Kktn
5,0,0,Point of questionable return.
3,1,0,I can't believe we got Johnson to fit in this but, trust me, the 'businessman jumping out of a briefcase routine' is a crowd pleaser.
6,0,0,Francis: things are looking up, this case is ours...
4,0,2,Did you use the "size of your briefcase" line again?
3,0,0,They call it a profusecase.
3,0,0,What did she mean that was a weird massage?
3,0,0,Nobody, I said, will miss the staff meeting
3,1,0,First job sharing, now this. I call it over-sharing.
3,1,0,Can I take my work home alone?
3,0,0,Trump supporter by any chance?
3,0,0,We're taking our work home with us. That means you.
2,1,0,These nuclear launch codes keep getting longer and longer.
3,0,0,Remember, we shake hands at the same time too.
3,0,0,Can we call it the not-so-briefcase?
3,1,0,What do you think about this new IRS Long Form?
4,0,0,Funny, I thought he was asking if we could carry a tune.
6,0,0,Well, you have to admit Smith's working himself to the bone to get the vice-presidency Roberts wound up giving his son for finishing nursery school is it's no sweat being his pallbearer.
3,0,0,It fits the bill.
3,0,0,He's taking Tiny Hands to the next level. This is his new Speedo.
3,1,1,What do you mean you want to cut out the middleman?
5,0,0,Briefcase share, not so much.

3,0,0,I'll brief you later on the case
4,1,1,How else to let her know that the deal is DOA.
2,2,0,First cubicles and now this.
5,0,0,Try to look sad.
3,0,0,It's a crucial part of our Secret Service training, Jones. If you're to be trusted to carry the 'football,' you must first learn to carry the football field.
2,3,0,When we get in there, you guys drop your ends and I'll pretend it's really heavy.

3,0,0,Now do you believe in economies of scale?
3,1,0,If he reads the whole contract we are screwed!

3,0,0,When he said we'd be sharing cases, I did not take it literally.

3,0,0,Don't worry. By your part of the pitch they'll be long past comatose.
3,0,0,'This BRIEFfcase is an oxymoron?' Gee, never heard that one before.
3,1,0,We've got a long case ahead of us.
3,1,0,If you'd said something funnier, he could've sold the cartoon to " The Reader's Digest".
3,1,0,It's nice to be on the case with you.

4,0,0,Three-piece suits are "out," but the triple briefcase will always be "in."
3,0,0,So the presentation was a bust. Why does the slide screen need an all-floors burial march?

3,1,0,So let me get this straight...the last one still holding on by the end of the week get's the window office?
3,0,0,This IS a heavy work load.
5,0,0,Does holding this section of our bag make me look gay?
3,2,0,I think this job sharing thing has gotten out of hand.
3,0,0,Thanks for giving me a hand, fellas - I've wanted a ping pong table in my office since I was a junior associate.

3,0,0,I can't wait until we go digital.
3,1,0,Leave this case alone.
2,4,0,Maybe 'Three Suits and a Guitar' isn't catchy enough.
3,0,0,So much for the sharing economy.
5,1,0,I'm tired of taking the freight elevator
3,0,0,And to the right is our team suite.
5,2,0,You guys are always on the wrong side of things.
3,0,0,If it was good enough for Tinkers to Evers to Chance in baseball, it's got to be good enough for us.
2,2,0,You know, I could just let go.
3,0,0,It's from the Diversity Compliance toolbox.
2,2,0,Remember: Let's be brief.
4,0,0,Do we have to be on the same team again?
4,1,0,Thanks for helping me with "Bring your surfboard to work day"!
3,1,0,I was sure it was good things come in threes.
3,0,0,Now that Mr. Trump is president, it takes 3 of us to carry the nuclear football.
3,0,1,Mergers and acquisitions.
4,0,0,It sucks we have to share.
3,0,0,Our presentation may go a bit longer than planned
3,1,1,I know Bill's work was his life, but we should have used a casket.
3,0,0,I'm trying to disguise my viola as an AK-47.
3,0,0,I represent the Stooges.
3,0,0,I think we've discovered the limits of the car pooling concept
3,1,0,Will I ever get a chance to be first handle?
3,0,0,Can you believe management is hiring consultants to help get rid of "redundancies"? What a waste of money.
5,2,0,It's nice to know that they can make a sandwich that fits in our briefcase.
6,0,0,Its a campaign contribution.
5,1,0,You have the left's perspective on some big issues.
3,0,0,Call Dr Ben Carson, quick!
3,0,0,Three's Company
3,2,0,Next time I want to lead
3,1,0,Sad that Donald was run over by a steam roller...
4,0,0,I don't know how he always gets to work before we do.
5,0,1,Think they'll suspect collusion?
3,0,0,We might have a difficult time getting this to pass as a carry-on.
2,2,0,As a cost saving measure, we're now considered one full-time employee.
3,0,0,when a board meeting feels like your going to a funeral
3,0,0,Seems like the briefs keep getting longer and longer.
3,0,0,On the contrary, I thought there was just the right amount of humour in our presentation.
3,0,0,You knew going in Earl - the conventions broken by three suited masseurs would ruffle some feathers.
3,1,1,.... I told you we would share this big case with you and I meant it...."
3,4,0,The boss wanted it on illegal size paper.
2,0,0,Somebody may say we look shifty, but we are just shifting hands.
3,0,0,Don't you think about time for Flat Stanley to walk on his own two feet?
3,1,0,The team-building activities lately are not working.
5,2,1,"Next time, we should think about the practical implications of a merger".
3,0,1,but we have separate rooms
4,0,0,They said it was a three man job
3,0,0,I guess 3 does not = company, after all.
5,1,0,And we're the most normal guys here.
3,0,0,How did you get him in there?
3,1,0,I told him he was getting too thin.
3,1,0,Seriously? You really see me as a micromanager?
4,1,0,Three men. One briefcase. Who will be next?
3,0,0,Look, it's not a bad bargain, but you don't have to hold your end up so high.
2,2,0,Nothing about this case is brief.
3,2,0,Well, it's certainly not a brief case...
3,0,0,Believe it or not, we used to have four on a briefcase.
3,0,0,You'vd been snooping in my files.
3,1,1,Get a grip, Ripley, we want to present a unified case.
3,0,1,We used to play with Hendrix.
3,1,0,Expect this briefing to run long.
3,0,0,''We save on buying separate brief cases."
4,0,0,It didn't work for the Romans either.
3,0,0,Welcome to the team. It's alot of paper work.
3,0,0,You'll find, at this level, that 'brief ' takes on a whole other meaning.
2,0,0,Could you stop humming the funeral dirge already!?
4,0,1,I know the boss wants synergy, but come on...
5,0,0,When transporting the Craby Patty Formula.
3,0,0,Do we fill out each other's evaluation, too?
3,0,0,We really killed that presentation!
3,0,1,Simple. Rifles.
3,0,0,She's onto us.
3,1,0,The super PAC says it's the only way to save the party.
4,0,0,Your yogurt is leaking again.
3,0,0,I never understood purses.
3,1,0,Thanks for helping me with my new tablet.
3,0,0,Because Mr. Trump has very, very, huuge, big plans
2,2,0,I agree, it is less suspicious than one assassin carrying a gun case.
3,2,0,Throughout the entire service I kept wondering how they got him into a briefcase
3,0,0,I think our presentation may be a bit long.
3,0,1,Beta testing the iPhone 8
3,0,0,How'd you get picked to be the Pallbearer? I won the New Yorker Caption Contest. Crazy Prize.
4,0,0,Shouldn't we stagger which side we're each on?
2,2,0,FORGET about trying to cut out the middle man!
3,0,0,It's horizontally integrated manufacturing.
2,0,0,We shoulda cut him up and got rid of him piecemeal.
3,1,0,It's the new IRS long form.
2,2,0,I can't wait until we can stop using the long forms.
6,0,0,Wait...I can't remember if we put the lock on the bike...
4,0,0,This new iPhone case is a real lifesaver, eh?
3,0,1,Hey stop complaining. I NEVER get the window or the aisle seat.
3,0,0,We're more left than you are even though we're on the right side.
2,2,0,I feel like a pall bearer for a really bad big idea.
3,0,0,Next time we each carry our own lunchbox.
3,0,0,I guess I'm not quite sold on this Briefcase-B-N-B idea.
3,1,0,Eyestrain will hit you bad by the third hour of staring at spreadsheets, but at least in this chain gang, there’s no shackle sores.
3,1,0,Next time we file a brief, we should use a narrower font.
3,0,0,I don't know about you but I have a really good feeling about that interview Jeff.
3,0,0,He wasn't joking when he said the case was loaded.
3,1,0,Sorry, I called shotgun.
3,0,0,I think you'll find our mentorship program is quite strong.
6,1,1,First time as an Executive Pallbearer?
3,1,0,I miss the days when our briefcase was short and succinct.
3,1,0,All he said was the case came with two paralegals.
3,0,1,This is nothing. You want to be in on my three man toilet invention?
3,0,0,I know management wants us to collaborate, but what happens to our March Madness pool?
4,2,1,Get ready for a lengthy presentation.
3,0,0,He has the heavy end.
3,0,0,So is this what they mean about a "team effort"?
4,0,0,We better win this.
3,0,0,Are you sure this is what the consultant meant by team synergy?
5,0,0,Guys, I know we are three men doing one job, but I think we could at least bring separate briefcases to work.
5,0,0,i dont think theyll know its a body
3,1,0,I still haven't gotten used to the merger.
5,0,0,I've always admired the boss for being a snake, but I never dreamed of being a pallbearer.
3,0,0,Two's a company, but three's a crowdsource.
3,1,0,I don't know about these new team briefcases. I don't like sharing my briefs.
3,0,0,Actually, the deal died days ago....we're the pallbearers.
3,1,0,Which part of being a team player did you not understand?
4,0,0,And if something should happen to him... Bam! We both move up.
4,1,0,I just meant I thought you must be from Britain - or a lefty.
3,1,0,When the boss said "Make the staff meeting entertaining", I don't think he meant bring a xylophone.
6,4,0,I wish mother wouldn't pack our lunches together.
2,2,0,I wasn't expecting a long, drawn out case.
3,1,0,This must be his briefcase, it's YUGE!
2,2,0,For the record, I hate our new business cards.
3,0,0,Because his will specified the mail delivery tube, but he wouldn't fit
3,0,1,No, it's the 31st. Your turn starts tomorrow.
3,1,1,This won't fit under the seat.
3,0,0,You think anyone noticed the huge luggage so far.
3,1,0,I think your lunch just moved into my jurisdiction.
4,2,0,It's quite an honor to carry Mr. Trump's briefcase.
4,1,0,Not a brief brief
3,1,0,I prefer my rideshare
3,3,0,Are we going to have to wear matching suits every day?
3,0,0,Miley's here.
3,0,0,After our collaborative meeting where should we go for our collaborative coffee?
3,0,0,How would you claim a tax loss carry-forward?
3,0,0,Sales calls to the Pallbearers Union are always a bit different.
2,3,0,I'm having second thoughts about the sharing economy.
4,0,0,It's the new triple secure delivery.
3,2,0,They only allow one carry-on.
3,2,1,All the pallbearing industry needed was a little professionalizing.
4,0,0,I thought it was rude how you called me a "stonehenge looking motherf*cker" in front of that lady. Actually, it was rude in general.
3,0,0,Dave, I thought that we all agreed to carry the briefcase with our left hand?
3,0,0,The agency is big on portmanteau words.
3,0,0,You never see my side of it, do you?
3,1,0,Pallbearer's United, Local 6
3,0,0,Gosh, Mark Cuban is an a$$hole.
3,0,0,I am glad we saved with this new online bag sharing service.
3,1,0,Don't you think this teamwork thing is getting out of hand?
5,1,0,If Doublemint sold, Quadrillionmint will conquer.
3,0,0,why is everyone looking at us ? its just a large box (with goodies) from our office "run don't walk"
3,0,0,Let's hope we enjoy Take Your Firearms to Work Day.
3,1,1,Even split three ways, this is a very big case.
3,0,0,We were in a band together. How did you know him?
6,0,0,Billable hours X 3, got it?
3,1,0,Trust me, it's harder to leave it on the subway this way.
4,0,1,Taking collaborative work home sucks!
3,0,0,Did you forget to bring our umbrella again?
3,0,0,Remember, the trick is to act invisible.
5,1,0,I hear it contains an alternate ending to "the sopranos"
3,0,0,I really feel the synergy.
2,0,0,We were told to deliver it to the Trump book depository.
3,1,0,Don't ask!
3,2,2,Mr. Trump's comb.
3,0,0,Ransomeware, really. Did you have wipe your macbook and print everything.
3,0,0,Elevators good. Revolving doors bad.
3,0,0,Hunt continues for Machinegun Slim.
3,0,0,Ok, so you're black, and you're right handed. Is there something else I should know about you?
3,0,0,Our inclusive workplace is counter-balanced by our uniforms.
3,0,0,You'll be my pallbearers when I'm terminated.
3,0,0,This business 3-way is no fun!
4,0,1,This High Occupancy Briefcase elevator is a great idea.
3,0,0,They won't suspect us, we're not Muslims!
3,1,0,I hope you remembered the fulcrum.
2,3,0,You are my right hand man on this deal.
3,0,0,Because we're a team. That's why!
3,0,0,First the rent-a-car, now the briefcase....I'll tell you this much: we are checking into three separate hotels!
3,0,0,If we weren't interns, we'd wouldn't have to share a desk.
3,0,0,When we get to the spiral staircase, I call back.
3,1,0,It's a bassoon.
4,0,0,I hate team projects.
4,0,0,Yeah, just in time to catch the final four.
3,0,0,I wonder if we're taking this collaborative workplace initiative too far?
3,0,0,It really is a three-man job.
4,0,0,So my wife says, ‘Why don’t you each get your own briefcase?’ Women, right?
3,0,1,I beginning to have doubts.
4,0,0,Sure it's cost effective, but brief case sharing is extreme.
4,0,0,These filibuster statements are killers.
3,1,0,"Remember...we come in on keyboard as soon as they announce that the economy is bound to improve." a
4,0,0,I should really be the first named partner at Schwartz Schwartz & Schwartz.
4,3,1,I told you we can handle this case.
3,2,1,This has nothing to do with Trump.
3,1,0,Why do I always get stuck in the middle of these long cases?
3,0,0,Wow, the briefcase-pool express elevator totally cuts our commute time!
3,1,1,Trust me - if accounting knows we have a 6-foot sub we'll never get rid of them
3,1,0,Told the TSA guy it was just rope for the three legged race, he just waved me through.
2,0,0,I express my individuality through my socks.

5,2,0,How long have you been carrying for Uber Briefcase?
3,0,0,Just remember, you're only the Third Attaché!
3,1,1,Whose turn to take it home?
3,1,0,Maybe we should've told her that we just share a briefcase...
3,0,0,Real men use Big Boy attaché cases.
5,0,1,Say what you will about the merger Bill, it is expected to promote synergy.
3,0,0,I don't care if you're right arm is an orthotic, you need to be on this side.
5,0,0,A long briefcase is an oxymoron. Yeah, yeah, heard it a million times.
3,0,0,They say the company plans layoffs, something about job redundancy?
8,3,0,I don't care how rich we made him. Winning an oversized novelty check doesn't give him the right to keep my pen.
3,1,0,We think you're taking "attaché" too literally.
5,0,0,Poor Higgins. Packaging was his world.
3,1,0,Legal-sized paper is for wimps.
6,1,0,Let go now , before they take your tan .

3,0,0,Over the years, I've perfected the illusion of sharing the load.
3,0,0,Talk about luck...three xylophone players in one office.
3,0,0,And his like was brief.
4,0,0,Shh! We only got the leg part, the rest of the pieces are still inside the room.
3,1,0,Can you handle it?
3,0,0,Keeping the GOP candidate secret until the last moment (or poll).
3,1,0,Whatever happened to being brief?
4,2,1,You two take the credit. I'm just the middleman.
3,0,1,Do you think they suspect we're cutting out early to go surfing?
7,1,0,Remember, we just deliver the check. Don't recommend a bank that can cash it. I try to avoid eye contact.
4,0,0,Toasted, Triple Long Sub, with everything on it.
3,0,0,It's a furneral just a board meeting.
4,1,1,Okay, this is good. We all have a handle on it now.
3,1,0,Token rightie
4,0,0,The board's really upset. We're gonna need to fall on our swords.
4,0,2,First we had to share a cubicle.
3,1,0,Most power trios only have one guitar, but this is ridiculous.
6,1,0,It's for our crowd sourcing presentation.

3,1,1,Leibowitz is losing his grip on this case.
3,0,0,He was on the zero-carb/fasting diet
3,1,0,What? You never heard of file sharing?
3,0,0,I know Hillary said it takes a village, but using three of us to lug his cigars around is a little much.
3,3,0,No case too big
3,0,0,Remember, all for one, one for all.
2,2,0,And it triples our billable hours.
2,2,0,It's a case, but it's not a brief case.
3,0,0,"Our presentation? I thought his critique* was rather lengthy." *underlined
2,2,0,Remember, act like we're not ready to buy!
3,0,0,Groupon?
3,1,0,I think you're coming with us.
4,1,0,Are you cheating on your wife with the paralegal tonight or am I? I know Fred was last night.
4,0,0,Back before the revolution we had roadies, we could choose our costumes and hair-dos, and heavy metal didn't mean a steel guitar case.
3,0,0,I'm just the middle man.
3,0,0,I never realized you were left handed.
3,0,0,Personally I don't see any redundancies here do you?
4,0,0,Have you seen our printer yet?
3,0,1,Share an office? Why?
4,0,0,I told you, elevator pitches are hard.
3,0,1,That's what I thought, too.
3,0,0,You mean I now have to remember THREE passwords that change every 3 months?
5,0,0,No way; just a flatter viola!
3,1,0,I understand that the NRA is having success in lobbying Congress to allow the carrying of illegal weapons.
3,2,1,You are always too far left for us.
2,2,0,I hope you put your name on your lunch.
2,2,0,Trust me. They do this at Google.
4,0,0,You know Ted, three on a briefcase is bad luck.
3,2,2,Here at Dooley, Daniels and Dunne, we take job-sharing very seriously.
3,0,0,You got a better way of getting him into the rally?
6,0,0,I'm telling you, there's something strange about this guy and his suitcase. Did you hear rustling coming from it?" "I've learned not to ask questions...
4,0,0,the dude we're carrying this huge sax for plays the most beautiful music
4,0,0,You said your right arm was stronger didn't you?
3,1,0,This team work stuff is getting out of hand.
4,1,1,Let's not take this diversity stuff too far, Jenkins.
3,0,0,We all share the same baggage
3,0,0,That's what she said!
4,0,0,It's gonna' be hell when he asks for the nuclear codes."
4,0,0,You can tell a lot about a person by the questions they don't ask.
5,0,0,Don't you hate spread sheets.
3,1,0,We've never had to bother opening it, so I don't bother asking what's inside.
3,0,1,So, for lunch—the five-foot hoagie, and we’ll sit on the sofa?
6,0,0,Remember back in the 80s when they told us that computers would result in a paperless society?
3,0,0,I can't wait to meet our wife.
3,0,0,Just say we're concealing a weapon.

3,0,0,No, our arrangement will not include a wife.
6,0,0,I'm glad we didn't choose the four-handle briefcase.

3,1,0,Here, polarizing views result in the get-along briefcase.
4,1,0,I forgot something.
3,1,0,Checked or Carry-on?
4,0,1,This’ll make it easier to massage the numbers.
4,0,0,Luigi, why do you always have to be right!!
3,1,0,They really took the company merger seriously, huh?
3,0,0,I've been quite impressed with the cohesion of our business units as a result of the merger.
3,0,0,If you fit, we'll sneak you out next.
3,0,0,I'm telling you, folding clothes is a thing of the past.
3,1,0,Simply a way to destinguish associates from partners.
3,1,0,The big brief case would've been completely ridiculous.
3,2,1,First it was three to a cubicle
3,1,0,This is definitely not a brief case.
3,1,0,The End, Flat Stanley. The. End.
4,0,0,No political statement necessary
3,0,0,I think I'm going to invest in my own suitcase from now on instead of share one with the both of you.

3,2,1,Try not to look suspicious
2,4,0,Johnson wanted to be buried in accounting.
3,1,1,Can we stop calling ourselves as the Human Centipede of tax law?
3,0,0,You want the Flying Magic Yoga next door.
3,1,0,Why would we each want our own briefcase?
3,0,0,New deal at the office, "Buy one get two free!"
3,0,0,Remember...he is going to play nice, you are going to play hardball, and I'm playing the middleman
4,1,1,This is gonna be one hell of a divorce case!

3,0,1,Worst three-way ever.
3,1,0,The airline charges for each carry on.
3,0,0,You lefties always screw things up.
3,1,0,This job-sharing policy has gone a bit too far.
3,0,0,I know we're in a sharing economy, but this is ridiculous.

3,0,0,Now remember, if anyone asks, our firm has been handling class action lawsuits for years.
3,1,0,Louie, you did bring the shells-- right?
3,0,0,We are THREE... mild and crazy guys!
3,0,0,Nice Jim.... Wasn't me Frank
3,0,0,The banging, I can explain...but, do you hear someone screaming?

3,0,0,Don't hate to be bearer of bad news?
3,3,1,This is the worst case scenario.
3,0,0,No, we don't all need to be handcuffed to it.
4,0,0,It's a harp. This elevator stops at the heaven level.
3,0,0,She really just doesn't have a handle on our case.
2,2,0,We let go on three

3,1,0,I hate presenting to mortuaries.
3,1,1,I think the benefits of file sharing were grossly exaggerated.
3,0,0,Can you believe they're still called 'briefs'?

3,1,0,Only Google! Not only do you get a free massage, you get it from three masseurs!
2,3,0,We always work as a team here.
3,0,0,The law firm of Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.
3,2,0,Keep working hard, Jacobs, and someday you'll move up to second handle.
4,1,0,I hate corporate's new paper size policy

3,0,0,If we forgot anything, I don't know what it could be.
3,1,0,Smithers, if we are to have a chance with this case, you have to get on the right side.
3,1,0,Everyone has their own story.
5,0,0,You have the other key, I forgot mine!
3,0,0,I understand getting rid of offices for cubicles, I even understand a common rest room, but making us share the briefcase seems almost anti-Trump.
4,0,0,Did you notice? Bill wasn't pedaling at company speed this morning.
3,0,0,Wadda you mean--at the back again??
3,1,1,Let's just hope that the publishing world is ready for "Flat Stanley Grows Up."
3,0,0,Perchance, did you prepare the slides on redundancy?
3,1,0,No, this is just the flip-chart easel. Who has the paper?
4,1,0,Dude... I'm so sorry your keyboard died.
3,1,0,This is carrying teamwork to far.
5,0,1,Tuesdays and Thursdays I get to use my left hand.
3,1,0,The elevator is easy...lets see if you can survive the revolving door!
5,1,0,I heard they fired Ron for not carrying his weight.
3,1,0,I can't wait till they go digital.
3,0,0,"So this is what they meant by 'becoming a partner'?"'
3,0,0,You guys aren't planing to eliminate the middleman are you?
3,0,0,What are you looking at? You've never seen a man with a briefcase?
3,0,0,Carpooling I get, but...?
3,0,0,It was your idea to file the long form.
4,1,0,I love this new team building exercise.
3,0,0,When it comes to cartoon captions truncated ones are the best.

3,0,0,He wants his enemies to know he arrived by stretch limo.
5,0,0,So, how long have you been delivering for V.I. Pizza?
4,0,0,In this case, it's not so brief.
3,1,0,How much further can we stretch this case?
3,0,0,It's suppose to "amplify" our "ecosystem".
2,2,0,The investors will love this.
3,0,0,I didn't want to be the only one with a man purse, but this isn't what I had in mind.
3,0,0,Mr. Trump has especially large briefs...
6,0,0,Miles, Dave and Sanjay prefer low-tech project collaboration, after deciding teaming software is just too impersonal.
5,0,0,I have my shift at 5:00 and a concert at 4:00.
3,1,0,Anyone for a triple martini?
3,1,0,I think the long and short of it is that we lost the case!
6,0,0,A failed attempt at "briefcase-pooling"
3,1,1,I was a pall bearer on the Schecter account, too.
3,0,0,Do you think our coworkers will be able to tell we're Sanders supporters?

3,0,0,This new technology could make smartphones obsolete!
4,1,0,I hate it when he gets the six foot sub.
2,2,0,The preferred term is 'middle person'.

3,0,0,We need to have a debriefing.
4,1,0,You can carry this without me, can't you?
5,0,0,Forget the ergonomic benefits, this has a real fun factor!
3,1,0,By the way, I won't see you guys next Monday. I'm taking the backpack.
3,0,0,He fudges the numbers, I display confusing graphics, you close the deal.
3,1,0,Don't you love this not so briefcase?
3,0,0,This is the biggest case I've ever worked on
4,1,0,Just between you and me, I’m not completely sure a suitcase full of old bricks is the Next Big Thing.
4,1,0,The three of us are needed to handle this case.
3,0,0,The Three Lawyers are going to be BIG!
4,0,0,As a former pallbearer, this way is a dream come true.
3,1,0,Remember: teamwork is everything with this client.
4,0,0,It's Trump's briefs.
3,1,0,Don't be rediculous, it has always been alphabetical.
3,0,0,I told you that near the end, he lost a lot of weight.
3,0,0,We may all be sharing the workload, but you guys are really doing the heavy lifting.
3,1,1,Next we change the light bulb.
6,1,1,Whoever called this a brief case never had to carry it.
5,1,5,Be alert. There's a revolving door up ahead.
3,1,1,They did warn me it was going to be a long case.
3,0,0,Tomorrow you drive!
2,2,0,I know it's not full of cash, but she doesn't.
3,0,0,Everyone just play it cool and we can sneak this surf board down to the beach after our 1 o'clock with finance.
3,1,0,After you've been with the firm about 5 years, you'll start seeing yourself on second handle too.
3,0,0,It's good to see that the company is finally diversifying.
4,1,0,These slim fit caskets are the best.
2,2,0,This case could be a long one.
4,0,0,I'm getting this sinking feeling that it's not going to be a brief case...
3,0,0,I'm tired of retorting, "Yes, in fact, our briefs are long."
3,0,0,These pallbearers' conventions are my only chance to get away.
4,0,0,It's his last will and testament.
3,1,0,This is exactly what they meant by work share.
3,1,1,Manager a trois?
3,1,0,Honestly I kind of like the middle.
4,0,0,All your presentations fall flat, Higgins.
3,0,0,Okay, when we get into the interview-- just remember, we're one person.
3,1,1,This time, let me do the reveal. You and Frank try and act surprised.
2,4,1,At the end of the day, you are either on our side or you're not.
2,3,0,On this case you're co-co-counsel.
3,1,1,You know, my mother always said I'd become an assassin.
3,1,0,Like they've never seen a professional pall bearer before.
4,1,0,I hate group work.
2,6,1,I say that next time we try the cases separately.

3,0,0,Do you ever get the feeling corporate doesn't understand?
3,1,0,Our work may get mixed up, but at least it can fit the entire hogie.
3,0,0,He losdt a lot of weight towards the end.
4,0,0,''Wish I was briefed first.''
4,0,1,Bet you didn't think carrying around a keyboard in suits can make you popular with the ladies.
4,0,0,Vertical integration is dead. Horizontal, however...
4,0,0,I'm not so sure that a troika can pull this off.
3,0,1,On April 15 I use the long form.
2,2,0,I love our carpool. I guess I just need more "me" time.
3,0,0,Next time, you get the middle handle.
3,1,0,Our desk is a 3-way too.
4,0,0,Keep acting inconspicuously and they'll never notice it is missing.
4,0,0,Are you sure Joe wanted to be buried like this?
2,2,0,This merger hasn't gone quite as I expected...
3,1,0,Not so sure how crazy I am about this new "sharing" economy.
2,3,0,I don't think this file sharing service is worth the money.
3,1,0,I told you, bigger is better.
3,0,0,I mean, I know they want us to be more collaborative, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,1,It's the terms AND the conditions
4,0,0,I assure you I can do this without you Price Waterhouse guys.
4,0,0,The amateur pallbearers never practice.
3,0,0,Then we'll have him laid out in the board room
5,0,0," It's just cumbersome".
4,0,0,Do you think she suspects the boss is in the case?
3,0,0,Right on cue.
3,0,0,You asked me to buy you that lottery ticket, but what about him?
3,0,0,Did you ever imagine being a pallbearer for an anorexic friend?
3,0,0,wait till you see what they did to the bathrooms.
4,0,0,I think that you're the one who's a team player, after all.
3,1,0,Bill Gates said the "middle man" would be extinct.
3,2,0,Next time, I call shotgun.
3,1,1,See that, she didn't even ask....
4,0,0,Just think but for Trump we would never had the folding stretcher.
3,0,0,I've got to take up a smaller instrument.
4,0,0,Don't turn around. She is still staring at us.
3,0,0,I think the Efficiency Department has gotten out of hand.
3,2,0,We're in it for the long haul.
3,2,0,The firm does not look favorably on rebellious, nonconformity such as you're showing right now.
3,0,0,Frankly, gentlemen, the prosecution is always tremendously intimidated by the size of my legal pads.
3,0,0,I'm not so sure the lengthy case is going to catch on.
3,1,0,We've decided to decrease our digital footprint.
4,0,0,Collaboration in the workplace. Not just a lady thing anymore, fellas!
4,0,0,Why can't I dream about flying, or something fun?
3,0,0,People will talk about this merger for decades.
5,1,0,This is a lot of work just to sneek a protester into the Trump rally.
6,2,0,File sharing has made the job a breeze.
3,1,0,When you said merger, this is not what I had in mind
4,1,0,Have you ever been to a mortician's board meeting?
3,0,0,Save for a few oversights, I'd say the merger was a success.
3,1,0,I have a handle on the case.
4,0,0,It is a pleasure and a honor to be a pall bearer of the terrorist rifle.
3,0,0,Are you sure the invitation said to bring your own table?
4,0,1,Ever handled a case this big?
4,1,3,I think she's impressed.
3,0,0,Big smiles, big smiles guys, or this briefcase made for a threesome will never catch on
3,0,0,I thought they called them briefs for a reason.
3,1,0,It took only one lawyer and was called a "briefcase"
2,4,1,We also have to screw in a light bulb today.
4,1,0,I really think we should think about going back to shorter legal pads.
5,0,0,What we lack in brevity, we make up in team spirit.
3,1,0,This company takes "collaboration" seriously.
3,1,0,we'll have more than enough towels now!
2,2,0,Yep, I'm the middle man.
3,0,0,It's important that we carry our own weight at this company.
6,0,0,There are downsides to the sharing economy.
3,1,0,I hope this doesn't mean I get the middle seat.
3,2,0,What is this, job sharing or power sharing or a three-way?
3,0,0,The Academy is pushing for more diversity...
3,0,0,I am warning you. If your apple rolls again, I will eat it.
3,0,0,Thanks, but I'd rather you guys share the actual workload.
3,0,1,It may be the company briefcase, but I occupy the central position.
3,1,0,On the count of three, we switch hands and directions, ready one, ...two
3,2,2,I hear they want hire one person to replace us.
4,0,0,This is what he wanted.
3,0,1,Remember. We can't look like pool hustlers.
6,0,0,Has it occurred to you that I'm always in the middle?
3,0,1,Don't tell me you forgot Exhibit Z-45392 Sub-Part 204.70000 again.
3,0,0,You know what they say about men with long briefcases----They have long dic-tations.
4,0,1,Thanks for the help, it's a really big case.
3,0,0,We better have one hell of a Shotgun Clause.
3,1,0,Timeshare gone too far.
6,1,0,She could have given one of us her number.
5,0,0,I value self-reliance above all else... in my employees.
3,0,0,Remind me: Are we three ad guys with storyboards, or three hit men with machine guns?
3,0,0,I don't know what's inside, anymore than you do....
3,1,0,Does either of you remember the combination to this thing?
3,0,0,This is the first time I've been a pallbearer for expired paperwork.
3,0,0,I get the whole three-in-a-box leadership model, but this is too much.
3,0,0,I still say he wanted a three piece suit.
4,0,0,Presentation teamwork begins now.
4,1,0,I definitely prefer acquisitions to mergers.
3,0,0,Lunch?
7,1,0,The mortician said I was crazy, but the carpool lane changes everything.
3,0,0,Time to file another class action lawsuit.
3,1,1,'Nice suit, I like your briefcase.' Of course she was talking to me.
3,0,0,It's the corporate ladder.
3,0,0,So were are the dream team, is that it?
3,0,0,But I really have to go!
5,0,0,I'm telling you, when they ask us to play, don't go ape on me again........
4,0,0,I prefer to think of it as a longcase.
3,0,0,This is the company solution to force us to share a taxi.
3,1,0,The D.A. said that this would be a long case.
5,1,1,What makes you think anyone would sit through a presentation of FOLDING yardsticks?
3,0,0,I'm all for sharing the litigation workload, but this.......
4,0,0,You realise, with this we are redefining the definition of "brief"!
3,0,0,No. Calendaring the team transport agenda is the hardest part of the Bassoon.
3,0,0,Snackular Degeration Diet subject line...No looking..
3,1,0,It's six sigma, they modeled it after the carpool lane
1,0,0,'Things get dicey in the bathroom.'
3,1,0,I don't mind sharing an office, but...
3,0,0,We should go for 'open carry.'
3,0,0,Trump wanted his family jewels insured by Lloyd's of London.
3,0,0,I told you, once we use the rest of the 8 1/2 by 33 paper, we can start using our own briefcases again.
3,0,0,Remember this is a hostile takeover. If there Board of Directors resits, we take out our weapons and shoot them!
3,0,0,You know- maybe people wouldn't stare at us as much if we didn't dress like the bad guys in The Matrix..
3,1,0,Just remember that his wife's name is Susan.
5,1,0,It's the only real way to move a billion dollars.
4,0,0,Sorry, Fella, but you guys seem way too one-dimensional to pull off this job.
3,0,0,If we assemble Dr. Carson early we can surely fix that anti-Trump glitch.
3,1,0,This was the only coffin that was available under Obamacare.
3,2,1,Longest brief I ever wrote.
4,0,0,Trump illegal?
4,1,0,What if one of us resigns?
3,2,0,Being your own man? Overrated.
3,0,0,I love bonding exercises, but you said how far?
3,0,0,Flat screen TV, guaranteed cure for the Monday Blues.
2,3,0,Even with the three of us flying together, I don't think this will qualify as "carry-on" luggage.
3,0,0,Mac OS X Python. Too literal?
3,1,0,Hansen would have wanted his memorial held on company property. And that steamroller definitely saved us on pallbearers.
3,0,0,I'll admit it: I had my doubts about the new synergy initiative.
3,1,0,I thought you said you were left handed.
4,0,0,I think we're telegraphing the 2-1 decision of the Court of Appeals, Judge Argle-Bargle.
4,0,0,It is a rule, you smelt it you dealt it.
3,0,0,Just my luck: I always get the middle handle.
3,1,0,Well that was the longest divorce case we’ve ever settled.
3,0,0,We don't need an *actual* ladder to get promoted.
3,1,0,We take our votes on where to go for lunch very seriously.
3,0,0,This guy thinks he's going to get away with one tip?
4,0,0,An awkward team-building exercise seemed like a fitting tribute.
3,0,0,They can't downsize us, we know where the bodies are buried.
2,1,0,Team building sucks.
3,0,0,The medium is the massage.
3,0,0,So, we're going with three pool cues, yeah?
3,0,0,I wonder what other atrocities await us during New Accountant Initiation.
2,5,0,Could you try to keep your Hi Ho's in time!
3,0,0,Who needs guns when you have the case?
4,3,4,We're only allowed one carry on item.
3,0,0,This corporate team-building thing has gone way too far.
3,1,0,I honestly don't think this is what a long brief is supposed to be
3,1,0,No offence Tom, but your elevator pitch needs work.
5,0,1,I hope you have your concealed carry permit with you.
3,0,0,Gun control.
3,0,0,Quit complaining! You sat shotgun in the carpool!
3,0,0,Call me a skeptic, but I'm still not sold on this whole sharing economy thing.
3,1,0,It is a triple murder we're defending.
3,0,1,For our next gig, let's get three harmonicas.
3,0,0,Thank goodness for concealed carry.
3,0,0,Pastor always uses his massage table to lay on hands.
3,0,0,Something just never look as luxurious as a stretch limousine when it’s lengthened.
4,0,0,We can't let the voters know.
3,1,0,I think I just figured out why it was on sale...
3,0,0,Thanks for helping carry my lengthycase.
3,1,0,The boss always takes a long lunch.
5,0,0,They're not gonna bury Nancy if I can help it.
3,0,1,This is not exactly what I meant when I said we should handle this together.
4,0,0,Well, it's time to retire this suitcase until next year's Academy Awards.
3,0,0,I didn't know "killer presentation'' meant THAT!
4,0,0,Job sharing won't be a good sell, let's go with XP - Extreme presenting.
5,0,0,I need to stop by my office first.
4,0,0,Since it didn't fit in the elevator, I guess we'll have to take the stairs to the 97th floor.
5,1,0,Don't you find it strange that we're all wearing the same suit?
3,0,0,Thanks for helping us this far, we can get it from here. It's just some of those little yellow statuette things, nothing special. Have fun watching the show.
3,0,0,I thought we'd never lay this case to rest.
4,0,0,The secret is whether this year's company Easter Bunny is dark or milk chocolate
4,1,2,I would have expected you to be on the left.
4,1,2,How do we get through the revolving door again?
3,0,0,I find it a little more heavy than awkward.
3,1,1,Of course I'm worried. People always want to cut out the middleman.
4,2,2,Just do what I do.
3,0,0,This is the casket for the guy in last weeks cartoon.
3,1,0,Today we dine at Subway...
3,0,0,Chauncey, let's not have any of that 'thinking outside the box' crap during today's presentation shall we.
3,0,0,This is taking teamwork a little too far.
4,0,1,Get a grip..
3,1,0,I'm not so sure about this "briefcase pooling" idea.
4,0,0,What The Donald wants, The Donald gets.
3,0,0,We're decoys; the real stuff is going out the back door.
3,0,0,I don't trust you guys, either.
4,2,0,I wish they'd finally do away with the extra long form.
10,1,0,It's the way he would have wanted it ...
3,1,0,And job sharing hits a new low.
3,0,0,Welcome to the chain gang.
3,0,1,We handel all our cases this way.
3,1,0,How did your interview go?
5,2,0,There is no "i" in bref.
3,0,0,I think this teamwork thing has run its course
3,0,0,Not my idea of how a bassoon trio would work.
3,0,0,I'm not sure renting a three man brief case is the best way to save money.
4,1,0,Man, these power lunches are getting longer, and longer and longer.
3,0,0,It's yyyuuugge
3,0,0,The ad said 3 assistants needed for company's attaché
2,3,0,I misunderstood when the partners said they were giving us the same case.
3,1,0,First, they made us share an office. Later, they made us share a cubicle. Now, this is just RIDICULOUS!
6,0,0,Let's try rolling the scroll next time.
5,0,0,Wait until the jury gets a look at these Mormon briefs.
3,0,0,From longships to long-tables, when does this end?
3,0,0,On the plus side, more rules, more decrees.
3,0,1,We need to make a pit stop.
3,0,0,Do you think the boss understood our Flat Tax briefing?
3,0,0,I hope we don't get a new co-worker today.
3,0,0,You know... you're not indispensable.
3,1,0,Taking this merger business a bit to far, don't you think?
3,2,0,I was just made partner.
4,0,0,We're being paid portmanteauvertime for this, right?
3,0,0,It's just, 'jumbo brief,' reminds me of George Carlin.
3,0,0,This case is anything but brief.
3,1,1,I've always said, 'legal brief' is an oxymoron.
3,0,0,I get the need for cost-cutting, but this is going a bit far.
2,2,0,I thought I'd get in some ironing during the meeting.
4,0,0,It's the giant hot dog from that other caption contest.
3,0,0,You think the prosecution is prepared for a lengthy case?
3,0,0,I bought it at a Mafia yard sale, recently.
7,0,0,When I joined the Secret Service the last detail I expected to receive was carrying Donald Trump's hair around.
3,1,0,I guess I misunderstood the term "Case Managers."
2,2,0,We'd take up less space if you used your left hand.
3,0,0,I never thought that "Working together on big projects" would look like this.
4,1,0,I believe this is the largest brief we've every filed.
7,0,0,These are the contracts for our NBA clients.
3,1,0,No! Get your own damn cab.
3,1,0,We are working the same case.
4,0,0,Wanna bet they try to cut out the middleman?
5,0,0,The boss certainly does a lot of weekend reading.
4,0,0,It's been a very long case.
7,1,0,So this is the guy from the February 22 cartoon. Wonder what happens to us after this week.
6,2,0,Great job maneuvering the elevator. Next challenge, the men's room.
4,0,0,What happens in the office stays in the office.
3,0,0,I'm obviously the tiger, Brad, so you're either the cabbage or the goat.
3,1,0,Be happy you got a full handle.
3,0,1,We all have to be on the same side on this one, Fred.
4,0,0,And they said the Xylophone Pro wouldn't have commercial applications!
3,0,0,I'm not sure this is what Corporate meant by consolidating departments.
3,0,0,He ain't heavy. He's my brother.
4,1,0,yes Mark, I know it is a "big" presentation
3,0,0,As usual, Greg's not holding up his end.
5,0,0,I'm wondering how brief this case is gonna be.
3,1,0,Three's company, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,0,Last week it was pall bearer, next week 10 foot subs for a retirement party.
5,0,0,They're going to shred it and spread the ashes across the Pacific.
4,2,0,Flip charts have saved our company a bundle in marketing.
4,0,0,This arrived right after the executive team building workshop.
4,1,2,I hate sax season.
3,1,0,Hey, know what? We would make *great* pallbearers.
2,2,0,You can't stay on that side in the bathroom.
2,2,0,Don't you think the sharing economy has gone a bit too far?

3,2,0,I wonder if she thinks we're compensating.
3,1,1,Don't blame me. I'm just the middleman.

4,0,0,How come I alway get the heavy part?
3,0,0,I worry the witness's deposition might be too long?
4,0,0,Bob, I think we should cut out the middle man.

4,0,1,My last case was even longer.
3,0,0,Either focus, Hal, or agree to a coxswain!
3,0,0,Everyone's watching us carry this stupid box.

3,2,0,I don't think esprit de corpse was what they had in mind.
3,0,1,Do you think the matching suits are too much?
5,0,0,Welcome to the sales team.

3,0,0,Apparently, opposing counsel doesn't believe that brevity is the soul of writ.
3,1,0,Is it just this, Wally, or the whole idea of Matrix Management that irks you?
3,0,0,What did Ben Franklin say about three keeping a secret?
3,0,0,Just use "joint" in the presentation.
3,0,0,This "Three's Company" reboot has really jumped the shark.
2,2,0,When I die, I'm leaving my handle to you.
3,0,0,Now are you convinced Trump is a liar? 'Small hands, big package.'
4,2,0,Welcome to the mergers and acquisition team!
5,1,0,At least we didn't share a bed.
5,0,0,I knew the judge would think our brief was too long.
3,2,0,That was quite a merger.
4,1,1,Well, it's not exactly a brief case.
3,1,0,Our vacations are even more interesting.
4,0,0,At the interview, remind them that we also carpool
4,0,0,You know what they say about men with long briefcases.
4,0,0,Three Surfboards in one carry-on. Good idea Mingo.
3,0,0,Never realised that working for a funeral directors staff are so helpful.
3,1,0,Welcome to J. McGintey's Coffin Works.
3,1,0,This is embarrassing. I wish he'd get his eyes checked.
4,0,0,You know, I've been saying it for years, but I really think Mr. Thompson is too liberal in his use of the term "brief".
3,1,0,Imax computers are going to be a pain in the butt.
3,0,0,I hate being conjoined at the toe.
4,0,0,Let's hope third time's the charm.
3,0,0,Not so sure about this Coworking Case thing.
3,2,2,Actually, we never ask what's in it.
3,1,0,I got shotgun after the presentation.
3,0,0,We're playing the St. Valentine's Massacre tonight.
4,3,1,Work hard and one day I guarantee you the center position.
3,1,0,Your meeting is in our other building?
3,1,0,Pallbearer practice for the funeral of the inventor of the briefcase.
4,0,0,Remember, I have front handle at pretrial.
2,2,0,I hear their trying to eliminate the middle man
7,0,0,I still think we would have less conspicuous carrying pistols in shoulder holsters.
4,0,0,This isn't what I had in mind when you said it was a long document.
4,0,0,It's how we maintain a full disclosure at the office.
3,0,0,Your just wrong if your not on the right.
4,0,0,It's what we get for working in the antonym department.
3,0,0,Remember, Bob, it's like a canoe. If you walk too quickly you'll keep steering us into the wall.
3,0,0,A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH IS MY BEST LUNCH!
3,0,0,We're here to massage the big Boss' ego
3,2,0,Some aspects of this corporate merger are silly.
3,1,0,If anybody asks, we are not together.
3,1,0,Let's eliminate the middleman.
4,2,0,My grandmother had a lot of silverware sets.
3,1,0,Don't take what she said personally. We have small hands too.
3,1,0,Are you sure this is scalable?
4,1,0,I thought I was just going to share the office!!
4,0,0,She may be a mom, a wife, a caregiver, a food provider, a teacher, a cleaner, and our coworker, but our job is far more important."
4,1,0,Don't worry-it is our second amendment right
4,1,0,What time are we taking our bathroom break?
3,1,0,I just think the three piece briefcase is not going to catch on.
2,2,0,His last wish was to be shredded.
3,1,0,The Johnson brief is anything but.
2,3,0,Well that was the longest divorce we’ve ever settled.
3,0,0,Paperless society? NOT!
3,1,0,Two's company, what are we?
3,0,0,It's just great to feel a part of something.
3,0,0,I am not really comfortable with a sharing economy.
3,0,0,It's the "not so brief" case.
3,0,0,Everyone is going to think this ramrod is a briefcase.
7,1,0,Quit your gripin'--plenty of musicians would jump at the chance to be second trombone and third handle.
3,1,0,Yes, the new long form is more difficult to use, but the ability to deduct escort services as physical therapy AND to bill at three times our normal rate make it win-win.
2,2,0,Don't believe anyone who calls them legal briefs.
2,0,0,This was the briefest case they had.
3,0,0,Ready for another long meeting?
3,0,0,Which way are you heading? I'm going uptown.
3,1,0,I can't believe they thought our script was too long.
4,0,0,It's our new approach. Outside casket salesmen.
3,0,0,Don’t complain, Stan — these new maximus amicus briefs fetch us $200 more per hour to print and file.
2,2,0,I miss moving bodies for disorganized crime.
3,0,0,What's the expected repair date for that paper cutter?
3,0,0,Hey,its my bag bub,if you want a bag go get your own.
4,0,0,Look, time was we used to bring violin cases to business with Trump. Is it any wonder, given the election, we bring a slide trombone case now?
3,1,0,Now we can triple-bill the client.
4,0,1,Are we shareholders now?
4,0,0,...appears we're on the same career track.
3,0,0,This is where it always gets awkward.
3,0,0,It's a new type of briefcase that guaranties we work together!
3,0,0,Legal size is back--with a vengeance!
3,2,0,I hope your briefs aren't touching mine....
3,0,0,Make sure Mr. Trumps wigs are cleaned and combed before he makes his speech.
3,1,0,They said that I would never be a team player. What do you think?
2,2,0,We're bringing the sharing economy to the workplace.
2,2,0,Congratulations on making partner.
3,0,0,Who but Trump would order 'designer' concrete samples? But I guess since someone else is paying for the wall….why not?
4,0,0,She was totally checking out the 'threefcase'.
5,0,0,I should have told her I have a big package.
3,0,0,Regardless whether the FIFO or LIFO rule applies in this instance, I still remain a ‘shmucko.’
3,0,0,We're all handling the case!
3,0,0,I'll take it odd days; you two split the rest.
4,1,0,Company's making some major cuts.
5,0,0,I don't think security has a profile for you in this configuration.
2,2,0,At this rate, the project for next month will be that big that we won't be able to enter in the elevator
3,0,0,Act like you belong ...
3,0,0,Two thousand bucks for alpenhorn lessons and the only gigs I get are cough drop commercials.
3,2,0,Don't you realize how strange you look when you walk on that side?
4,0,0,Sorry, but I'm just not that into the whole squad goals thing.
4,0,0,When I told him we'd carry the legal burden together he thought I was being literal.
7,3,0,Are we all on the same page?
3,0,0,Wait till David sees Goliath's case.
3,1,0,Are you sure this is a "concealed carry" state?
3,0,0,RyanAir.
3,1,0,This job sharing isn’t what I thought.
5,0,0,Steve always said this job would kill him.
3,0,0,It's all about teamwork, but the leg chain can drive you nuts.
3,0,0,Are you two plotting to cut out the middleman? middlemen.
3,1,0,I thought our job ended at the funeral, now we have to carry the will too?
4,0,0,it was easier to handle during previous administrations, but now it's YUGE.
4,0,0,Shhhh---we got him with a bulldozer.
4,0,0,Accessorizing with synergy suits you.
4,2,0,Oh, good--now we can get in the HOV hallway.
3,1,0,It's the 'team player' concept run amuck!
3,1,0,One of Trump's audits......its hugggeeeee!
3,0,1,It's gonna be a long trial
3,0,0,I kept warning him to fix the parking brake on that steamroller of his.
3,0,0,Remember, act like we just met.
3,1,0,Why couldn't we just use PowerPoint for this meeting?
4,0,0,I think Larry is taking our equal partnership agreement a little too far.
4,0,0,Do we really need to file this brief together?
3,0,0,The telecommuting ban has been taken way too far
2,2,0,The boss wants everything in triplicate!
4,1,0,He gave his life to this company.
3,0,0,Went well except for that subway turnstile.
3,1,0,So you're the one on the other side of this case.
3,1,0,As you'll learn, we're all about collaboration here.
3,1,0,It took me three years to get the middle handle.
3,0,0,This should show them that the " Father, Son and Holy Spirit" is a real name for our company.
3,0,0,Thanks for help carrying "I am not a terrorist" proof!
3,0,0,He refuses to take sick days.
5,2,0,I'm a little worried about the revolving door in the lobby.
3,1,0,This better stop with your third-party filing.
3,0,0,Socialism sure makes work lighter.
3,1,1,This is the last time we use a bazooka for an indoor hit.
3,2,2,Must you always speak in the third person?
3,0,0,Well, you should have thought of the revolving doors when you came up with "briefcase-pooling", Bob.
3,1,0,Did you hear that?
3,0,0,Corporations are people too, but their coffins are more compact.
3,0,0,I know you work with us but you are really not welcome at the Oscars.
3,0,0,I hate this new IRS Long Form.
3,0,0,The coworking trend has gone too far
5,0,1,Whose side of the briefcase are you on, anyway?
3,2,1,Mr. Trump likes to keep his comb close at hand.
3,1,0,I'm actually a big fan of this new job-sharing program.
4,0,0,Do you think she suspects anything?
4,2,0,It's our biggest case yet. Our only worry is the courtroom door.
3,0,0,You know the last one of these we carried turned out to be your partner's casket?" "Yeah? Well, let's hope that this one is your wife..." "...Agreed.
6,0,0,Thanks, guys. It's for my hot dog.
4,1,0,You should have seen the size of his hands...
3,0,0,Think I'll manage the next case on my own.
4,0,0,We need to refine our Elevator pitch.
3,1,0,If you stay on the right side of the case we will look more bi-partisian
2,2,0,Why shouldn't it be you at the back of the briefcase?
3,0,0,I should warn you that this ensemble never walks in common time.
3,0,0,... and that, my friend, is what you do when they face the wrong direction!
4,0,0,Don't you think these days equal partnership is taken to seriously?
3,0,1,Ok , technically yes, this could be a threesome.
3,1,0,Why are you always on fhe wrong side?
2,2,0,Remember at the corners you and Johnson walk clockwise.
2,2,0,I really appreciate you for being a pallbearer for my portfolio.
3,0,0,Thanks guys. I have a few CVS receipts to submit with my expense report.
3,0,0,Something wrong with your left hand Bob?
4,0,0,I told you the prosecution had a strange case.
5,1,0,''We are not taking a bus.''
3,0,0,Well, at least he's a burden we longer have to shoulder.
3,0,0,Ever thought of getting your own briefcase?.
4,0,0,Now you know what we do with people who give lousy elevator speeches.
4,0,0,Someone should have told me about the Boss's Inner Punster before I insisted that we all be put on the same case.
5,1,0,I still have my doubts about this amicus briefcase.
5,0,0,This will stop them from talking about our small hands!
3,0,0,This new trumpet is going to be a big blow off!
3,1,1,Yup, flat as a pancake.
3,0,0,Theirs are just briefer.
2,2,0,You've always chosen the wrong side, Albertson.
3,0,1,Now if we can just get out of the lobby we're snowboarding by lunchtime.
3,1,0,Yes, I guess having a 52" notebook does kind of defeat the purpose.
3,1,0,Sharing a salary is where I draw the line.
3,0,0,How do you think Ned's doing?
3,1,0,I get to go first next time
4,1,0,Cash like this? Definitely a king mattress.
3,0,0,If these smart phones get any bigger, I swear I'm giving 'em up.
3,0,0,It's a bobsled.
3,0,0,Do you even lift?
4,0,0,Perhaps it would be better for the team if we each had our own briefcase.
4,2,0,We felt a violin case was too Godfather.
3,1,0,Maybe we're taking this carpooling thing a little too far.
4,1,0,If you get tired, we can change sides.
3,3,1,And most important of all, don't exit through the revolving doors!
3,0,0,Briefcase, schmeef-case
3,1,0,I'm the one doing the heavy lifting
3,0,0,I don't care if we are triplets! I want my own briefcase!
4,0,0,If we can sell square bowling balls, we can sell anything.
4,0,0,Same time next week?
3,0,0,Well that idea went over like a lead bassoon.
3,0,0,Which way to the roof?
3,0,0,How can we be sinister if you walk on the right side?
3,0,0,This your first joint project here?
3,0,0,I'm excited to see the paperwork for Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
3,0,0,We're admen, Richards. We present ideas to the client, then load them in the hearse.
2,2,0,Not so bad being a pall-bearer for an anorexic.
3,0,0,I wish you two would get off my case.
4,0,1,So just who selected the super-ultra-mega legal size paper anyway?
2,3,0,I worry that I'll never move beyond middle management.
6,1,2,Remember when machine guns used to fit inside violin cases?
3,2,1,These forms are still required in triplicate.
3,1,1,Do you think she noticed?
3,1,0,Just once I want to be first.
6,0,0,I know we carpool - but this is a little to far.
5,0,0,What will Airbnb think of next?
3,0,0,''Why do I feel like a middle child.''
3,0,0,You're drawing needless attention to yourself.
3,0,1,Wait till you see what the team building experts have done with the toilets.
3,1,0,Mergers...
4,0,0,I'm in for Lars, he was promoted to the satchel unit.
3,0,0,The amount of clothes my wife needs for a two-day trip never ceases to amaze me.
3,1,0,This merger is a real pain in the...
4,0,2,I call shotgun
4,0,0,I told you - keep in brief and to the point - but noooo.
3,0,0,I always deliver my tax return in person.
3,0,0,Threesomes are all the rage now.
4,1,0,Who's idea was it to bring the not-so-brief case.
2,2,0,No. You're in the back because we're left-handed.
3,0,0,Pallbearing just isn't what it used to be.
3,0,0,So... how long have you played team billiards?
2,2,0,Long story...
3,0,0,This new Android design is going to be huge.
3,1,1,He says 'coming about', you shift to the starboard side.
3,2,1,It's the biggest case of our careers.
4,1,0,When will our hands hit puberty?
3,0,0,Parker ordered it when he heard the new CEO was into threesomes.
3,1,0,Can't we just use triplicate forms for once?
3,0,0,If your hand starts to hurt, I'll switch sides with you.
4,0,0,Well this is awkward
3,0,0,Count D. know you're moonlighting, day-shift dude?
6,0,0,I can't believe we didn't think to Ubercase sooner.
3,0,0,You've heard of a bass clarinet? This is a Sub contrabass clarinet and your playing tonight.
3,0,0,It could be extra-long spaghetti or even peacock feathers, you never know.
3,0,0,Can't be too rich either
3,1,0,Did you notice anything odd about her?
4,0,1,I still think this looks more suspicious.
5,0,0,This isn't working for me; I want to go back to having my own briefcase.
5,0,0,It's either this or we're joined at the hip, and frankly, cowhide is more cost-effective.
6,1,1,Wait till you see our men's room.
3,0,0,Her purse looks big enough for a human head. Creepy.
3,0,0,I think I still prefer a briefcase.
3,1,0,This all-in-one technology is getting a bit out of hand
3,0,1,Thanks for helping. I've just always wanted to try one of those big subs.
3,1,0,Is it heavy? I'm just faking it.
3,0,0,He's big on mergers.
3,0,0,By the way, Moe, I paid extra for your handle.
2,4,3,I'm just saying, I can see why the 'brief'case is more popular.
3,3,1,Get off my case, Fred.
2,0,0,It's important you get on the RIGHT side of the sharing economy
4,1,0,You might think she never saw men share the same briefcase before.
3,3,1,I preferred it when we could just fire a guy.
2,0,0,I understand you name is Trey.
4,2,1,Well, you're taking the middle seat in the plane.
3,2,0,Small hands!
5,0,1,Remember, we're all taking equal credit
3,0,0,How else should we carry our long underwear?
2,1,0,Whose house tonight?
3,0,0,Just remember, small hands big briefcase.
4,0,0,This is what we get for encouraging the boss to attend that "Sharing the Load" seminar.
3,0,0,We're just taking the "three men in a room" concept to its logical conclusion.
4,0,1,Whose turn was it to bring lunch today?
3,0,0,I think the sharing economy may be going a bit too far.
4,1,1,Congrats, guys. We are now too big to fail.
3,3,1,The strategy is to draw this case out.
5,0,0,I almost forgot today was Take Your Pallbearer To Work Day
3,1,0,Did you remember to bring the extra-long paper clips?
4,0,0,I miss the old days when we carried bodies in a duffel bag.
3,0,0,Remember, if TSA asks, we packed this ourselves.
3,0,0,You're right, the elevator is faster.
3,0,0,The boss said to get to the office ASAP as soon I as I told him we were presenting a lengthy brief.
6,2,0,Stop following me!
3,0,0,Well she gave us a look...what's her problem?
3,0,0,Credit assisting living.
5,0,1,How about, "I know that the boss said that we should team up on the next case, but this is really cramping my style with Joan"
3,0,0,If anyone asks, you're my nephew.
4,0,2,Yes getting hit by a steamroller is a terrible to die but think of all the money Stan is saving on pallbearers.
3,0,1,Next week our secretaries carry in their ironing board
3,1,0,The two-handled version was so 2015.
3,1,0,I think we have a pretty good handle on this case.
7,0,1,Roger, it may feel like a body; it's just lunch for those nice folks in purchasing.
3,0,0,On three.. take a right.
3,0,0,Of course we’ll have to change the name to Dewey, Cheatem, Howe & Rappaport.
3,1,0,When the boss said to bury the project, I didn't realize he meant literally.
5,0,0,I'm not vulnerable, the IT dept. warned me about your man-in-the-middle attack, they said I'm protected. Must be that blond back there.
3,0,0,This attaché sharing thing is in the ozone.
3,2,0,Just follow his lead and try to keep up.
4,1,0,Remember when all we needed was a violin case and a tommy gun?
5,2,0,The prosecution isn't expecting a long, drawn out case.
3,1,1,Did you have to tell her we carry our 'briefs' in here?
4,1,0,I get the whole open floor plan, no cubicle thing, but sharing a briefcase is taking it a bit too far!
4,0,0,Maybe 'teamwork makes the dream work', but taking that cab ride here would have been a lot easier on my own.
3,1,1,Are you from the steering committee?
2,2,0,I never thought I'd be an attorney for the Pallbearer's Union?
6,0,0,Next they are going to merge us into one big one.
3,0,0,This is the biggest deal I ever worked on
3,1,0,Do you always have to be on the opposing side of everything?
3,0,0,Peddle harder!
3,0,0,It's a not-so-brief case.
3,1,0,who's this guy in front of us?
2,4,1,Next time we should go for the premium file-sharing service.
3,2,0,It's all about sharing the workload.
3,0,0,My bad. "I'm a team player", I said.
3,0,0,I had hoped that 'Three Man Briefcase Group' would take me to off-Broadway, not office birthday parties.
3,1,0,I think we have a handle on this case.
2,2,0,Security only spot-checks, so just act natural.
3,0,0,We couldn't have chosen a *brief*case?
3,1,0,Don't you hate these treble damage cases?
4,0,0,It's either Trump's hair, or the wall. We haven't quite figured it out yet
3,0,1,Those High-Occupancy-Briefcase-Only express elevators sure make the hassle worthwhile.
4,0,0,Remember, everything that's important we learned in pre-school.
4,0,0,I'm used to being in the middle. I was a middle child.
3,0,0,This deal never had a chance.
3,0,0,Have you read our annual report? 'Pallbearer' is an appropriate job title for us.
3,1,0,Call it what you want. It's still just a really big sandwich.
3,0,0,There's no turning back now.
4,0,0,I'll be so glad when the jury comes back on this nasty faulty ironing board liability case!
3,0,0,I'm afraid the firm's experiment with six-foot legal pads is not turning out the way we'd hoped.
3,0,0,Have you ever considered the sawed off version?
4,0,0,Again, when I told Mr. Simpkins we would take the case, I had no idea.
3,0,0,Have a good night's sleep last night? I happened to notice you tossing and turning a little.
3,0,0,I know, but it was either this or just an iPad.
5,0,1,She asked for a three-way.
3,0,0,Between this suitcase and McDermott's death stare, we should convince them to settle without a trial.
3,0,0,I'm a big idea man.
3,0,0,Why don't you give him the kiss of death?
3,0,0,Get over here, people are starting to stare; this is London and they carry on the other side.
3,0,0,Let's keep this case civil, Ricardo.
3,0,0,Don't bring a knife to a gunfight.
3,0,1,Does our briefcase make my ass look big?
4,1,1,I know it's a long shot but................................
6,0,1,He groaned at the CEO's jokes.
3,0,0,When did I sign up to be a pallbearer for the corporate world!
3,1,0,I prefer middle handle on the tandem briefcase.
3,0,0,Did the judge say 'brief'?
3,1,0,Job sharing is a joke.
6,1,0,Office sharing taken to the next level.
3,0,0,Okay, it's not obvious, we've got the body so keep rolling
2,0,0,why the long file?
3,1,0,We're in kind of a legal gray area here.
4,1,0,Tomorrow we go to your office, Frank.
4,1,2,What do you mean you forgot your combination number?!
3,0,0,$349 is a bargain for a 4 foot hoagie when they throw in the executive carry-out option.
3,0,0,Eyeball replacements
3,2,1,Somehow, I never envisioned myself as part of a lawyer three pack from Costco.
4,0,0,What's the opposite of "merger"?
3,1,1,It''s expected to be a long trial.
5,0,1,At least we can take the HOV elevator now.
3,0,0,We never speak of this again..
4,0,0,I heard the next move is to make us share a single Netflix queue.
3,0,1,Something tells me our project is DOA.
3,2,0,These mergers are becoming a little excessive.
3,0,0,Hard to believe that I first resisted this idea.
4,1,1,So, tomorrow am I driving?
3,0,0,This brings 'working in tandem' to a whole new level.
2,2,0,I'm middle management.
4,0,0,Still better than at the hip....
3,0,0,Yes, you're right, the handcuffs would have been totally overdressed.
3,0,0,I hate you, and I hate the sharing economy.
3,0,0,I think the people upstairs are taking this Teamwork Initiative a little too far.
3,3,1,Who's side are you on, Lewis?
2,2,0,Let's just hope they also don’t know what a Bassoon Trio really is.
5,0,0,Stop asking questions, just carry on.
4,0,0,No matter how many samples they take, it still comes back with more Prozac than Cymbalta.
4,0,0,Ted just always has to be first handle.
4,0,0,Aw. Freeze drying, an elevator, half as many pall bearers, this new technology is making the funeral business so much better
3,0,0,"Remember when we thought hot-desking was tough".
3,0,0,Which way to the Mortuary?
4,0,0,Well I heard that Fred here is retiring, and you're gonna get the middle handle.
3,0,0,We're here for the Oscars, you?
3,1,0,Don't forget- we don't yell Happy Birthday until she jumps out.
3,1,0,Remember to kill the conference room lights right when I go into my solo.
3,0,0,It's good training for later.
3,2,2,If you stand on this side, we'll just look silly.
2,0,0,If we are going to briefcase pool together maybe we should also carpool together?
3,0,0,Shhh-- we chopped up the boss into teeny, tiny pieces.
5,1,0,What an honor to be Bloomberg's pallbearer, right?
3,0,0,It's just as Vita requested . I stuffed her pockets full of rocks and now we're going to drop her and the cats in the East River.
3,1,0,You know - maybe three is a crowd, but two couldn't carry this thing, and it's an important presentation.
3,0,0,The lawyers made us do it.
2,0,0,Well, it's lighter than a coffin.
3,0,0,When you're a lobbyist, you have to carry a lot of cash.
4,4,0,Do you think they'll suspect anything?
4,0,0,Now don't forget. It's happy anniversary, not birthday.
5,1,0,The IT people asked for a new platform and this should do the trick.
3,0,0,First we carpool together, and now this.
3,0,0,Does this equate to larger paychecks?
3,3,3,Act normal.
3,0,0,Due to the size of the dearly departed the funeral home only needed three pall bearers.
4,0,1,Play your cards right, you'll be standing on this side in two, three weeks.
2,2,0,When I said three's company, I didn't mean literally
3,0,0,I've learned that the middle man gets paid for doing nothing.
3,0,0,I've never sold limousines before.
3,0,0,The design team didn't appreciate the danger posed by revolving doors until it was too late.
4,0,0,This presentation may look like a stretch.
4,0,0,When I suggested we balance the workload, this is not what I had in mind.
2,4,0,I honestly thought that 'consolidating our workforce' meant getting laid off.
3,0,0,No offense, guys, but I'll be glad when they fix the regular printer.
2,2,0,Your turn in front will come when we walk back.
4,0,0,Sometimes you ned a three man briefcase
3,0,0,Panoramic Powerpoint handouts.
3,0,0,These long cases are really a drag.
3,0,0,This is taking job sharing too far!
7,1,0,This triplet thing is getting to me.
3,0,0,You can present first.
7,3,0,I think an electronic shared folder would be more effective.
3,0,1,You're just third handle, so try to keep a lid on it when we get in there.
5,0,0,They told me to bring along that big dummy
3,0,0,Hey, I don't want your stuff touching mine.
4,0,0,We didn't fold it, I can't say if it is bent or mutilated.
3,0,0,Sure it works. The trick is to convince them it's pocket-sized.
3,0,0,I suppose it's too late to change my mind.
3,0,0,I don't really feel that I'm pulling my weight.
3,1,0,Legal briefs keep getting longer.
3,1,0,I didn't used to to think that "long form" literally meant long form.
3,1,0,I don't like this team briefcase anymore than you do.
3,1,0,We need somebody more flat-chested than her.
3,0,0,Trust me - three man pool is the greatest game ever invented.
3,1,1,We forgot the myrrh.
3,1,0,Do you think this deposition might be too long?
3,0,0,It's a new super computer. This is just the keynoard.
3,2,0,Remember when bassoonists carried their own instruments?
4,0,0,Next time can we take the Hearse?
3,1,0,Ok guys, let's make this brief.
3,2,0,I wish we were drawn with bigger hands.
4,1,1,I'll tell you what's in here; it's a long story.
3,0,0,All for one and one for all.
3,0,0,It's the big short, so shuddup!
3,1,0,It started as a one page memo, then it went to Congress.
3,1,0,Our legal briefs are longer than usual.
3,0,0,Do YOU feel more autonomous carrying out these team-building exercises?
2,2,0,Judge Richards prefers briefs on 8" by 50" papyrus.
3,2,0,It is a rather lengthy brief.
3,1,0,Welcome to the sharing economy.
3,0,0,Let me do the talking...we don't want to appear weird if we all talked at once
5,2,0,This isn't what I had in mind when they said that we're merging companies.
3,0,0,This is my 3rd merger. How about you?
3,0,0,We should trade this in for one with wheels - wha'da think?
2,0,0,So, how are you related to the thin man?
3,0,1,I think it's time that we learn PowerPoint.
3,0,0,Mr. Trump said something about needing it for his huge briefs.
4,0,0,To be honest, Reginald, I just don't know if this "not-so-brief case" was such a good idea.
3,0,0,Remember, bring out the Bazooka right after I say ' Are you ready to pay for the wall yet Mexico?'
4,0,0,Jobsharing
3,0,0,They said this would be brief.
2,2,0,I'm just happy we're not sharing a brain.
3,1,1,I still say we should not have brought the long form!
3,0,0,CPA triumvirate on the case, brah.
3,1,0,So, what's the deal with your eyebrows?
3,0,0,Longboard Squad, out.
3,0,0,I hope one of you brought the extra mouthpieces for our bassoon.
3,0,0,Thanks. It's called 'a not-at-all-briefcase.'
3,0,0,I'm not looking forward to the bathroom breaks at this meeting.
3,0,0,"That's quite enough of '??Three bags full'.
4,0,0,He's my mentor, just like you're my mentee.
3,0,0,What do you think is in Fatboy Slim's briefcase?
6,0,0,This'll be the LAST time she asks us to keep it brief.
5,0,0,When is Charlie going to start carrying his own weight?
3,1,0,Hope they included napkins with our five-foot hero.
2,2,0,No matter what case we're working on, you always have to take the other side, don't you.
3,0,0,I don't know why but I just feel like our proposal is going to be dead on arrival.
3,1,1,Carry-on can be a problem
3,1,0,You sure this is the client that craves sea serpent sushi?
3,1,0,This thing is perfect for our "board" meeting"
5,0,0,There is nothing brief about this brief case.
5,0,0,Man, why even bother?
3,1,0,We're prepared for a lengthy trial.
3,1,0,Don't worry, they won't suspect a thing.
3,0,0,The next time they ask if I'm a team player, I'm saying "No".
3,0,0,New office stationery policy....we write on scrolls.
3,2,0,Play your cards right kid and this handle could be yours in a few years.
2,2,0,Next time, let's demonstrate teamwork on the cloud.
3,1,0,First day working at a pallbearer's office?
2,2,0,Ralph, why can't you side with us on this case?
5,0,0,Tell him these nuclear codes are getting ridiculous.
3,0,0,We went paperless.
2,3,0,I told you it wouldn't fit in the overhead rack.
3,0,0,I anticipate a real long session today. So I left my brief case at home.
3,0,0,Yes, POTUS' list of potential Supreme Court nominees is getting quite long.
2,2,0,Do you know who killed this project?
3,2,0,And who was the brainiac who kept insisting that the concept just needed a little massaging?
4,0,0,Any fonts larger than 36 pts have to take the service elevator.
3,1,0,This teamwork initiative is getting out of hand.
4,0,0,We are coming today to bury Flat Stanley.
3,0,1,I think the report stretches the truth a bit much myself. We were one small fib away from not fitting in the elevator.
4,1,0,Why do you always get to handle the light weight, Jerry?
5,1,0,The court is expecting briefs. Wait 'til they see our long-johns.
3,0,0,I always wondered what was meant by the "sharing economy".
4,1,1,Just follow us.
3,1,0,And briefcasepooling saves on what now?
3,0,0,The consultants said it would promote teamwork!
3,0,1,That steamroller sure made pall bearing easier!
3,1,0,Just act nonchalant.
3,0,0,Ivana. Your mom?
3,1,0,"It's how he would have wanted ".
3,3,1,My handle is redundant, isn't it?
3,0,0,Henry had answered the odd job ad. Henry got the job. Henry's first day as Suitcase Carrier Helper.
3,1,0,OK, already, I won't call it a briefcase again!
3,1,0,Technically, I'm not lying. I told my wife that the FBI finally has me be working on a really big case.
3,1,0,I’m so relieved it was a closed briefcase ceremony. The client would have wanted it that way.
2,2,0,Yes, the carpooling made sense, but we're now carrying it too far....
5,0,0,I'm tired of being on the heavy metals demo team. Plus, I think it's making our eyes bug out of our heads.
3,0,0,Asking for raises altogether was unwise.
3,0,0,I can't shake the feeling that if we downsize, I'll be the first to go.
4,0,1,So how does this work with carry-on?
2,6,2,Must you always take the opposing side of every case?
3,0,0,oye vey seymour, whose bright idea to schlep this trunk? next delivery, we hire a broad minded musical schlemiel to haul this contraband.
5,0,0,What's that saying again? Three connected briefcases are better than one.
3,0,0,I hope this cellist gets our vibe.
3,0,0,Don't drop it—I used to be the lead handler.
2,2,0,Tuesday is red tie day, Bob.
3,0,0,Light as a feather, it's great to be the middleman!
3,1,0,It might improve teamwork if we also share a bed.
5,0,0,Have you noticed Bernie has two more left sleeve buttons than me and one more than you.
3,0,0,Is this Long Dong's briefs?
3,1,0,Remember...were not the hit men..we're just here for cleanup.
3,0,0,"As always, we're the 3 Briefkateers".
3,0,0,A full weekend of Hamster Backgammon!
2,2,0,This isn't about taking sides.
3,0,1,It was a very long brief
3,0,0,I see this as the first step in my career path to become a professional pall bearer.
3,1,0,It's better than sharing a paycheck.
3,0,0,Remember "Carlito's Way"?
3,2,1,You're sure they said actual boiler plate.
3,0,0,I told you to play the flute.
3,0,0,Ted, we're a team. Get on this side.
5,0,0,No I'm not an origin donor, why do you ask?
6,0,0,We need to table this!
2,0,0,Even though the boss says, believe him, there's no problem, we've been asked to present photos.
3,0,0,I use this to carry giant squeeze packs of catsup and relish in case one of the IT guys brings another giant wiener for lunch.
3,1,0,Glad its an NRA approved violin case. There's an RPG launcher inside.
3,0,0,This company has the weirdest team-building exercise for new hires, don't you think?
2,2,0,You're right. The HOV elevator is faster.
3,1,0,I'm the new guy, Paul Bearer.
5,0,0,We can take it from here. Your role was purely utilitarian.
3,1,0,When the boss said he had a big case for us, I thought he was talking legal.
3,1,0,Couldn't we have just written a check?
5,0,0,They'll never be looking for a body in a body-size suitcase carried by three people.
4,0,0,Next time we don't use Amazing Enzo the Escapist as our getaway guy.
3,1,0,Today is carrying the corporate briefcase. Tomorrow is climbing the corporate ladder. And Wednesday is the potato sack race.
3,0,0,The case load's the same but now we can triple bill.
3,0,1,Who said they were briefs?
3,0,0,Would you please get on the other side. You're attracting attention and embarrassing us.
5,1,0,This meeting should put an end to the "Where's Hoffa?" question.
3,1,0,The new 'bring your own table' to the conference room concept is catching on!
4,0,0,Who're we kidding?
3,1,0,It demonstrates that we share the weight fairly.
5,0,2,What do you mean 'Do I even lift?'
3,1,1,Are you sure this is what they meant by triplicate?
3,2,1,We all need to be on the same side this meeting, Kevin.
4,0,1,This isn't what I thought the boss meant when he said this was a three-man case
3,1,0,How else would we deliver a giant check?
3,1,0,I hope the new "communal team" concept stops at the door to the washroom.
2,2,0,Well, I guess I did write 'works well on teams.'
3,0,0,These three guys need to hold one suitcase because of their ridiculously small hands.
3,0,0,This sharing society thing has gone too far!
4,0,0,I guess we should have expected this in today's sharing economy.
3,2,1,I look forward to the day when all of us can be on the same side of a case.
3,0,0,Team work makes the dream work.
3,0,0,It's a good thing Fenton has a left arm.
3,0,0,Remember--they're boxers, not briefs.
3,0,0,For a man with such small hands, he certainly has large briefs.
3,1,0,I think its time we took another look at affirmative action
3,0,0,The boss got this "team" idea while attending a funeral.
3,0,0,I guess we're having another sleepover.
3,0,0,I draw the line at sharing my briefs.
3,0,0,No way Hubley's team is as matrixed-in as we are.
4,1,3,It's a long brief.
3,0,0,No, no, no! That's MY exit strategy!
4,0,0,My idea is better than yours.
3,0,0,The boss is heavier than he looks.
3,1,0,I guess you could say we're... three-briefing.
5,0,1,Remember, it is just a big violin.
6,0,0,I'd help fellas, but I only make 79% of what you do so you should be able to handle it.
2,2,0,Are we all going to the same meeting?
3,1,0,Mr. Trump said to put his ego with his other baggage
4,0,0,I had a feeling this proposal wouldn't survive the day.
3,1,1,This new teamwork initiative has gone to far.
4,0,0,No, I do not want to get the nine foot sub sandwich again.
3,0,0,We'll have to add another handle for gender equality.
5,0,0,Now that we're no longer conjoined, can we get separate briefcases?
3,0,0,It's for Donald Trump's penis. It's yuuuuuuge.
2,2,0,Like I told you, this is the biggest case the firm has ever handled.
3,0,0,I always thought 'the long arm of the law' was just a figure of speech.
3,0,1,You're a righty?!
3,0,0,I think it's best that we work as a team
3,2,1,And I thought car pooling was inconvenient.
4,1,0,Made more sense when we sold skis.
3,1,0,I told you stupid ideas work.
3,1,0,Are you sure we shouldn't look inside before we bury this overly large briefcase in the desert?
2,0,1,Only one person can pull the trigger, you know.
4,1,0,You're not holding up your end.
3,0,0,There's a landfill behind the office where we can bury this idea.
3,2,2,I take it this is your first three-way?
3,0,0,Wait, you work on the second floor?
4,0,0,This is my fetish.
3,1,0,It's from the short-fingered store, but I guarantee you there is no problem.
3,1,0,Who gets the lunch?
4,0,0,Really, guys, does President Trump's wig case really need a Secret Service detail?
2,2,0,I hate these long, drawn-out arguments.
3,1,1,It's a Mormon divorce.
2,2,0,This is why we call it "a Board Meeting."
2,2,0,I really hope this is the last of the long forms.
5,1,0,Let's just slide the bill under the door.
4,0,0,you and your bargain attaches...
4,1,1,It's a new type of paper called Super-legal.
3,1,0,I've decided that I won't be making any more SkyMall purchases with you.
4,0,1,I hope this huuuge case distracted her from noticing our small hands.
3,0,0,He's not heavy, he's my broker.
2,2,0,Because extra-legal activity requires extra-legal size paper.
3,0,0,They called it a merger;but I never thought they give us one briefcase too work out of.
3,0,0,If you forget the presentation, can you dance the twist?
3,0,0,No Bob, they’re not taking the team bond exercise seriously enough.
3,0,0,Not easy being third string
6,1,0,Poor Stanley. He never saw that steamroller coming.
4,0,0,I don't think it's going to be an open and shut case.
3,1,0,Let's hope the doorman doesn't remember we were booked as a quartet!
3,0,0,It was a committee decision.
3,0,0,you know, ever since the boss started on nutrasystem, this carrying him to the limo is SO much easier...........
4,0,0,Plausible deniability isn't as big a deal as it used to be.
3,0,0,Well, he did ask for a rock guitar.
2,0,0,We bill by the handle.
3,0,0,You're the new adjunct attaché?
3,1,1,So how did you know Slim?
3,0,0,It's my first board presentation.
3,0,0,Isn't there an app for file sharing?
4,0,0,I didn't realize that airport security would be such an issue, either.
7,1,0,I still say 3 brief cases would have been better than 1 lengthy case.
3,0,0,The courthouse is a good place for us legal pad salesmen!
3,0,0,At least we're not carrying a tuba.
4,1,1,When you said threesome this isn’t what I had in mind.
3,0,1,You know the judge is going to throw this case out.
3,1,0,She's probably never seen one that long
3,1,0,Who's bright idea was booking separate rooms?
3,0,0,It's a good thing Jim got his stomach stapled a couple years ago.
3,0,1,I miss being a Pallbearer but prefer working indoors.
3,0,0,You ask him. I'm tired of being the middleman.
3,0,0,Gotta jam with my band right after the hearing.
3,1,0,You sure attachépooling is a thing?
3,0,0,Don't you just love team-building activities?
3,0,0,I hope our next President simplifies the diversity regulations.
5,0,0,His presentation fell a little flat.
4,0,0,How often does the NRA think we'll need a grenade launcher?
3,1,0,This is the longest brief the boss ever gave us.
4,0,0,This wasn't my idea of a triumvirate.
3,0,0,I just told them flat out 'no!' to sharing a secretary.
4,0,0,I guess this can't be considered a 'briefcase' technically.
2,2,0,I heard it's the new EZ form.
3,2,0,Relax ! It's a lot better than a body bag.
4,0,0,You think they're going to accept our massaging their numbers?
3,0,0,If this works, we are going to try it on Trump, Cruz and Rubio.
3,0,0,I think we left the xylophone in the car.
3,0,0,For a T-Rex, it's awfully light.
3,1,0,When is this "shared economy" going to end?
3,0,0,Golf clubs, maybe?
3,0,1,Downsize THIS.
3,1,0,Hi. I don't think we've met. I'm Bob.
3,0,0,"I think I'm getting too attached to this attache case".
3,0,0,Just wait till you see the "teamwork toilets."
3,0,0,C'mon Fred, you know the drill. Carry with the left and shake with the right.
4,0,0,Clear your calendar. We are literally involved with a long case.
3,0,0,You can lead tomorrow Jack. Now get back into line.
3,1,1,It's gonna be a long meeting.
3,0,0,You take the kill shot, we'll handle the collateral damage.
3,0,0,Our 'unified team approach' sucks in elevators.
4,0,0,Wiener dog jokes at a Dachshund murder scene are over the top
3,0,0,They need three of us?
3,0,0,And someday, if YOU make all the sacrifices necessary to reach the top of the lackey's ladder, YOU'LL get to grab the middle handle.
3,0,0,Don't worry. If any one asks, just erase their memory.
4,1,0,If he says no, I open the case, Barry aims it, and you fire. Okay?
3,1,0,It's a union requirement…
3,1,0,I'm rethinking the carpool.
3,1,0,I told the judge it wouldn't take long and there was only one page of women's signatures, claiming sexual abuse.
4,0,1,Personally, I think doing everything in triplicate is a waste.
3,0,0,From now on, I'm going to handle this case my way.
3,0,0,I suppose you also want to cut out the middle man.
3,1,0,Apparently it's a bad idea to bring a list of Americans killed by guns to a Ted Cruz rally
3,0,0,Stop it! No will notice three dudes in suits with a three handle suitcase!
3,1,0,I love carpooling with you guys, but I don't think I'm ready for this next step.
3,1,0,Our workload has literally gotten heavier.
3,0,0,You know, since his promotion he won'the even make eye contact with us.
3,2,0,We need a briefer case!
5,0,0,Do you think anyone suspects?
3,0,0,I'm starting to rethink this briefcase pooling idea.
3,0,0,There's collaboration, and then there's codependence.
3,0,0,Wrong Side, Wrong Hair, Don't give me that look!
3,0,0,This is not a very brief case...
3,1,0,This isn’t what I had in mind when I signed up for job sharing.
2,2,0,The Boss wanted to be buried this way.
3,0,1,Did you remember to pack our tooth brush?
2,3,0,No reason to be nervous - the other pallbearers will love our presentation.
3,0,0,We like to emphasize teamwork.
3,0,0,I'm also going to need your help in the men's room.
5,1,0,No one ever gets fired here.
3,0,0,Of course it's three-brief case. That's why they call them tri-als
3,0,0,Extendocase, when an ordinary briefcase just won't do!
4,0,0,I thought that went well except for the "casket of the future" crack.
4,0,0,I don't think it will be a good idea to call it a "brief".
3,0,0,If we stare at each other, maybe no one will notice.
3,1,0,There are rumors of everyone getting their own when the market rebounds.
3,1,0,These investors are going to love our idea for extra-long legal paper.
3,1,0,I'll be Curly this time.
4,1,0,It's going to be a long trial we might as well make some massage side money.
3,1,0,Synergy sucks.
4,1,0,I was afraid he might get carried away.
4,0,0,It's so sad that he unincorporated.
3,0,0,This is the longest brief I've ever filed.
2,4,0,Post-merger integration they said
5,0,0,Hey, try and say attentive attorney's attached attache five times fast.
4,0,0,Now remember…when we get on-stage I’ll count to three, we let him out and all yell, 'Happy Birthday, Boss'.
5,0,0,This is carrying "in triplicate" a bit too far. Don't you think?
3,3,1,If we turn around, will you stop talking about Rosa Parks?
3,1,0,A diva to the very end.
3,0,0,This thing is like a nicotine patch for my pall bearing addiction.
3,1,0,Follow me; I lead from the middle.
3,0,0,Fred gets Mondays and Wednesdays, you get Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I get the weekends...
3,1,0,I've never been to a briefcase's funeral before.
2,2,0,Do you think the editor will say our paper is too long?
3,1,0,If you think this is bad, wait until you see the new toilet seats.
6,0,0,The size of this brief better not correlate with the length of the trial....
3,1,0,Enough with the middle man jokes already!
4,0,1,You forgot the missile launch codes ??!! Uh oh. Me too.
3,0,0,Do you really think they'll like what we brought?
3,0,0,I'm starting to think the sharing economy has gone too far.
3,2,0,There's talk of merger.
3,0,1,The boss's new 72-inch laptop.
3,0,0,Separate attaches just didn't make sense.
3,1,0,I remember when bribes fit in a normal briefcase.
4,2,1,Yeah, but just wait until you see the new legal pads!
3,0,0,Did anybody remember the Post-its for the wife?
3,0,0,We have to get this to Hillary quickly, decent penis size is the new campaign must-have.
3,1,0,It's perfect for the extralegal size paper.
3,0,0,I never thought I'd be auditioning to be a pallbearer.
3,1,0,Just once can't you side with me on a case?
3,1,0,This is a joint venture.
3,0,0,I'm telling you. Briefcase pooling is going to be the next big thing.
3,0,0,I know there is economy of scale, but this this is a nuisance on the bus.
4,1,0,Evidently getting run over by a steamroller requires only three pallbearers.
3,4,0,You should see my business cards.
3,0,0,I can't believe I'm working for the NRA. I can't believe I'm about to meet a senator. Hey, what's in this briefcase anyway?
3,0,0,A machine gun would be really cool. But this is a bass clarinet.
5,2,0,I hope this judge has no problem with long briefs.
3,1,0,Compared to a casket it's a piece of cake
3,1,0,This is an important pitch, Keller. Get a grip!
3,1,0,There's letter size, there's legal size, but the real money is in tabloid size.
