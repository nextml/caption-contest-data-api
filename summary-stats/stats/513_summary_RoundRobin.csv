5,0,0,Lighten up already.
4,0,0,We used to call it the football, but that was before it was possible for a wackjob billionaire to win the nomination. Now it takes three keys, and we call it team nuclear hockey sticks.

4,0,0,Dibsonfrontwhenweleavetoday.

4,0,0,Do we make our presentation using Trump's logic or Hillary's principles?
4,0,0,And how, exactly, do you plan to shake hands with the client from that side?
4,0,0,Extendocase, when an ordinary briefcase just won't do!
4,0,0,I do not think anyone suspects there is the boss's subway sandwhiches in here, do you?
4,1,0,Briefcase, schmeef-case
4,1,0,So this is socialism huh?
2,1,1,Well, it's certainly not a brief case...
4,0,0,Strange he was so thin and wanted to be buried at work.
4,1,0,When you said merger, this is not what I had in mind
3,1,0,I forgot something.
3,1,0,Everyone has their own story.
3,1,0,I never thought that "Working together on big projects" would look like this.

3,1,0,So far no one has asked.
4,0,0,What did she mean when she said we remind her of Donald Trump?
3,1,0,This means we all get indicted together.
4,0,0,Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz holding Immigration laws with Hillary in the back.
2,2,0,I'd help fellas, but I only make 79% of what you do so you should be able to handle it.
4,1,0,You're not pulling your weight around here.
3,0,1,we'll have more than enough towels now!
3,1,0,Actually, I did hope I'd get a job transporting ventriloquists' dummies when I grew up.
4,0,0,This isn't what I had in mind when you said it was a long document.
3,1,0,For the record, I hate our new business cards.
3,1,0,Who knew the sharing economy would go this far?

3,1,0,The rifle case lets them know that we mean business.
3,1,0,It's all about collaboration now, Fletcher.
3,1,0,I told you that our presentation should have been outside the box.
3,1,0,Believe me, it's tough hailing a cab.
4,0,0,Small hands? Let's just say this is what I need to carry my gloves.
2,1,1,Pool cues. What's your line?
2,1,1,Like they've never seen a briefcase before!
2,2,0,I wish mother wouldn't pack our lunches together.
2,3,0,You would think she never saw a threefcase before.
3,1,0,Briefcase share, not so much.
2,1,1,First, they made us share an office. Later, they made us share a cubicle. Now, this is just RIDICULOUS!
3,0,1,Why can't I dream about flying, or something fun?
4,1,0,Next week our secretaries carry in their ironing board
4,0,0,So, how long have you been delivering for V.I. Pizza?
3,1,0,I think that this is the second longest legal brief ever written.

4,0,0,I never thought I'd be auditioning to be a pallbearer.
4,0,0,This briefcase exchange is going to be much harder than we initially thought
3,0,1,You don't really have to do this.
3,1,0,It's complimentary with our stretch hummer.
3,2,0,A full weekend of Hamster Backgammon!
4,0,0,I can't believe we got Johnson to fit in this but, trust me, the 'businessman jumping out of a briefcase routine' is a crowd pleaser.
5,0,0,The boss seems to think this is going to help us mix up our ideas.
5,0,0,I don't know why he can't the interns to shred his emails.
1,0,2,Don't blame me for deal falling through... I'm just the middleman.
4,0,0,I take it this is your first three-way?
3,1,0,Remember, if TSA asks, we packed this ourselves.
3,0,0,How long have you been carrying for Uber Briefcase?
4,0,0,Not a brief brief
4,0,0,I'm thinking 'Uber Attache' is a bridge too far.
4,0,0,Does this briefcase make my hands look small?
5,0,0,Do you think the boss understood our Flat Tax briefing?
3,1,0,Billable hours X 3, got it?
3,1,0,If you ask me, streamlining has really gotten out of control.
4,0,0,I prefer middle handle on the tandem briefcase.
5,0,0,Couldn't we have just written a check?

4,1,0,This is the big one. We all need to be on the same side.
4,0,0,I told you that near the end, he lost a lot of weight.
4,0,0,I think you've moved too far to the left.
4,0,0,Remember, I'm in charge. You two are not along for the ride. Just the carry.
4,0,0,Of course it takes three of us: we all have small hands.
4,0,0,Never, never wanna see what's in the box!
2,2,0,Nothing about this case is brief.
3,1,0,How do I say this? This thing is just a cover. I left the memory chip in the airport washroom.
4,1,0,The next time, remember to buy a ream of 8x10.
4,1,0,Why can't Donald Trump carry his *own* penis?
4,0,0,My name isn't Malcolm
4,0,0,Mr. Claus asks that we check it a third time.
2,3,0,Some day I'll have my own bassoon.
2,1,1,How much more can we merge?
4,0,1,So who gets to use the health insurance this month?
4,0,0,We have a big case to present.
4,0,0,I should really be the first named partner at Schwartz Schwartz & Schwartz.
4,1,0,I didn't say it was 'an important trial' I said it was 'a really big case'
3,1,0,All he said was the case came with two paralegals.
2,1,1,It's a bargain compared to the briefcase for two.
5,0,0,a rare illustration of the"middle man" brief case
3,1,0,I know this firm is known for extra-long briefs ... but this is ridiculous!
4,0,0,Trust me, this proposal is D.O.A.
3,1,0,It's better than sharing a paycheck.
2,2,0,First we had to share a cubicle.
4,0,0,It takes either the three of us or one man with shoulders.
3,1,0,This must be his briefcase, it's YUGE!
5,0,0,I'm an equal opportunity bagman.
2,2,0,Nobody will suspect we have hotel towels in here.
3,0,0,I didn't think this was what the boss meant by "merger"
3,1,0,Good news, I hear Ben Carson is taking surgery appointments again.
3,0,1,What happens when one of use needs to use the restroom?
4,0,0,This partnership thing is over done.
4,0,0,Why do we always have to pay cash?
5,0,0,I thought he was a no good snake.
2,2,0,I've been working on the long range forecasts.
3,0,1,Yes Mel, "The Will" mentions a preference for Southpaw pallbearers
5,0,0,I heard rumors we're being replaced by Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz.
2,1,1,We also have to screw in a light bulb today.
3,2,0,First day at pallbearer school?
3,1,0,The overhead bin's fine, but we will be walking to St. Louis if it must be stowed under the seat in front of you.
3,2,0,I think you'll find our mentorship program is quite strong.
3,1,0,Think they'll suspect collusion?
4,0,0,You mean I now have to remember THREE passwords that change every 3 months?
4,0,0,In this case, I really think the execs would've forgiven Bill's absence.
4,0,0,Don't worry, not even Marco can make fun of your hands here.
4,0,0,What is this, job sharing or power sharing or a three-way?
4,0,0,Someday you'll carry me out of here.
3,2,0,You're on the wrong side of the case again, Arthur.
3,1,0,The executive bobsled case always wins us gold.
3,1,0,It's nice to be on the case with you.
3,1,0,I'm starting to think the sharing economy has gone too far.
3,1,1,"When do I get to be up front'?
2,1,1,We want an element of surprise with a bit of fear
3,0,0,Isn't there an app for file sharing?
4,0,0,"Yell loudly and carry a big briefcase" - Donald Trump
5,0,0,Was it necessary to get an extra long keyboard?
4,0,0,hey bro
3,1,0,"Skinny" here never did like elevators.
4,1,0,I am glad we saved with this new online bag sharing service.
3,2,0,We better win this.
3,0,1,We've got this Davis, we really only need two pallbearers for the thin man.
3,0,1,I get the carpooling, but remind me how this is better for the environment again?
4,0,0,He losdt a lot of weight towards the end.
4,0,0,The three of us are needed to handle this case.
5,0,0,This is nothing. You want to be in on my three man toilet invention?
2,1,1,So my daughter tells me we should be worried about this thing called "the cloud".
4,0,0,I think an electronic shared folder would be more effective.
3,1,0,It's brief, but not that brief.
3,1,0,There is no Y in TEAMWORK.
5,0,0,Well, you should have thought of the revolving doors when you came up with "briefcase-pooling", Bob.
4,0,0,Common planning time is a pain in the butt.
4,0,0,Our religious liberty brief is on a stone tablet.
3,1,0,Remember, we just deliver the check. Don't recommend a bank that can cash it. I try to avoid eye contact.
4,0,0,I can't believe we didn't think to Ubercase sooner.
3,0,1,This'll be the LAST time she asks us to keep it brief.
1,3,0,They will agree to settle before we even open it.
4,0,1,We should trade this in for one with wheels - wha'da think?
4,0,0,Trust me, middle management is nothing to aspire to.
3,1,0,I look forward to the day when all of us can be on the same side of a case.
4,0,0,I'm not always on his side.
3,1,0,You're certain the competition is the Three Man Brief-Sled?
3,0,0,If we turn around, will you stop talking about Rosa Parks?
4,1,0,A bicycle built for two made a lot more sense.
4,1,0,To be honest, Reginald, I just don't know if this "not-so-brief case" was such a good idea.
3,2,0,I guess this is okay, but did we have to share that stall?
3,2,0,The design team didn't appreciate the danger posed by revolving doors until it was too late.
4,0,0,I go in the middle because I'm more senior than you.
5,0,0,..and what if it's like a barber pole.
2,2,0,I think we have a handle on this case.
4,0,0,I'm not so sure about this "briefcase pooling" idea.
3,0,1,The judge said he dislikes long briefs.
3,0,1,Why was she staring at us?
3,0,1,Hey, try and say attentive attorney's attached attache five times fast.
4,0,0,This is how we at Phillip, Bustyr and Blather do briefs, my boy.
3,1,0,Well, I mean, jobsharing yes. But who had this silly idea of sharing the briefcase?
3,1,0,Thank God Ben Carson's back!
4,0,0,Any other sword swallowers here for the tryouts?
4,0,0,Talk about falling flat on your face!
4,0,0,This case could be a long one.
3,0,1,I told her it's the iphone7+++
4,0,0,Can't we just use triplicate forms for once?
4,1,0,There's an element of teamwork required here, Jones.
4,0,0,The chairman's whole "stretch-limo" thing began when his ex said he had small hands.
4,0,0,This job sharing has gone too far!
4,1,0,Remind me again how this ping pong table is part of our strategy?
4,0,0,Compared to a casket it's a piece of cake
4,0,0,What happens when one of us quits or gets transferred?
3,1,0,I get those middleman comments all the time.
5,0,0,The swordfish brief
4,0,0,On three.. take a right.
4,0,0,Perhaps it would be better for the team if we each had our own briefcase.
2,2,0,If he reads the whole contract we are screwed!
2,2,0,In five years, I'm gonna be the guy holding the front handle.
4,0,1,I'm worried there's been talk of cutting out the middleman
5,0,0,Stop following me!
3,1,0,I thought for sure Cuban would have invested 200 grand for a 25 percent stake.
4,0,0,I thought our job ended at the funeral, now we have to carry the will too?
2,2,0,This is the most collaborative office I've ever worked in.
4,0,0,I guess we can't keep calling this a 'BRIEF' case.
4,0,0,I hope the sub isn't too soggy from the mayo.
3,1,0,I guess we're having another sleepover.
4,0,0,Not so surprising for three paralegals bitten by a radioactive cockroach.
2,2,0,If we forgot anything, I don't know what it could be.
4,0,0,I hope our suitcase doesn't get us in trouble like it did last time." "I'm worried we'll get that mad secret-agent room again." "Guys, we're here. Let's open the door..." "ITS THE SECRET AGENT ROOM!
4,0,0,Bob, I think we should cut out the middle man.
2,0,0,These streamlined coffins are so easy to carry.
3,0,1,Yes, POTUS' list of potential Supreme Court nominees is getting quite long.
4,0,0,These hard working men always have to carry this huge case which really has nothing in it!
3,1,0,It's an all hands meeting
4,0,0,We should stick with the original pitch for our shared economy business idea. "Suitcasely" - for men in suites who work in the same office and are in the same meetings all day long.
3,2,0,I hate team projects.
4,0,0,Sorry, but I'm just not that into the whole squad goals thing.
5,0,0,There's safety in numbers, but this is silly, we're grown men.
2,1,0,I always deliver my tax return in person.
3,1,0,This High Occupancy Briefcase elevator is a great idea.

2,1,1,I don't really feel that I'm pulling my weight.
4,1,0,His last wish was to be shredded.

3,1,0,I'm really glad we could go into business together.
4,0,0,That's two down to one up!
4,0,0,Well that was the longest divorce case we’ve ever settled.
4,0,0,I heard lay off notices were today.
3,0,0,If you forget the presentation, can you dance the twist?
2,2,0,Well, that was easy. I imagine the restroom will be a little tougher.
5,0,0,It's attache-d case.
4,0,0,Next time can't we just mail a check to the Superpac?
3,1,0,Not my idea of how a bassoon trio would work.
2,2,0,Can't believe TSA didn't blink
2,2,0,Whose side of the briefcase are you on, anyway?
4,0,0,They said that I would never be a team player. What do you think?
4,0,0,This is on you Otto! I'm telling you to bring her too. If this gimmick doesn't sell steaks in his chain, I know he'll want to put the Big Haired Lady out front again!
3,0,0,I hate being under office arrest.
3,1,0,Oh for god's sake, it's not like this is a bus.
4,1,0,It's a good thing we all work on the same floor.
3,0,1,The Donald brief's are in here. They're huge, if you know what I mean.
4,0,0,When we bring in the "Big Guns" everybody's always surprised they're in a big case.
4,0,0,I just don’t think it says “Mad Men” to our clients.
4,0,0,I hear lots of Americans are working longer.
4,0,0,Hey, I don't want your stuff touching mine.
3,1,0,I told we should should have kept it brief.
2,2,0,Don't forget- we don't yell Happy Birthday until she jumps out.
2,2,0,Now you know what we do with people who give lousy elevator speeches.
4,0,0,Are you guys here for the accounting job too?
3,0,1,Remember, we're all taking equal credit
4,0,0,You know the last one of these we carried turned out to be your partner's casket?" "Yeah? Well, let's hope that this one is your wife..." "...Agreed.
3,2,0,I read they do this at Google
4,0,0,It's the best pool cue in the house.
4,0,0,Are you sure this is scalable?
3,1,0,I hate going to long meetings.
4,0,0,Is it just this, Wally, or the whole idea of Matrix Management that irks you?
4,0,0,Our clients like us since we never dropped a case.
3,0,0,That steamroller sure made pall bearing easier!
4,0,0,Well that idea went over like a lead bassoon.
3,2,0,In this case, we are not going to file a brief.
3,1,1,I didn't think this is what you meant by file sharing...
4,0,0,It's our biggest case yet. Our only worry is the courtroom door.
4,0,0,A team that carries a briefcase together, works well together.
3,0,0,Our reading of the constitution is especially rigid.
4,0,0,You know, we can't all take this case.
3,0,1,Next time tell him we'd rather not pay in small bills.
4,0,0,Why are we carrying left-handed and you're not? Could it be your religion?
4,0,0,I hope you have your concealed carry permit with you.
4,0,0,Why can't you be a team player and carry on your left?
3,1,0,Like they've never seen a professional pall bearer before.
4,0,0,That's none of your business, snake. I mean Blake.
4,0,0,Mac OS X Python. Too literal?
4,0,0,Effects of the agency's teamwork initiative were becoming apparent.
4,0,0,Hands off unless you have a license to carry.
3,1,0,This laps-top is designed to encourage teamwork.
4,1,0,Don't go all "Rosa Parks" on us Lester. It's strictly a coincidence.
4,0,0,All the Millennials carry group briefcases nowadays.
3,1,0,Honestly I kind of like the middle.
3,1,1,I hope they don't eliminate the middle man."
4,0,0,This merger has gone too far guys.
4,0,0,This attaché sharing thing is in the ozone.
5,0,0,I'm beginning to have doubts about our budget file sharing system.
3,1,0,Don't you find it strange that we're all wearing the same suit?
3,1,0,It's not a briefing, Wallace it's a long-johnning.
4,1,0,How can we be sinister if you walk on the right side?
4,0,0,There's nothing brief about it
4,0,0,My bad. "I'm a team player", I said.
4,0,0,"No back seat driving, please." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
3,0,0,I guess obesity took its toll on the poor dachshund.
3,1,0,Would you please get on the other side. You're attracting attention and embarrassing us.
3,1,1,Consultants need to make a really big first impression
5,0,0,I hope this doesn't take too long.
3,1,0,I thought we each had our own when we got on the elevator.
4,0,0,I'm glad we packed our lunches.
3,1,0,He's my mentor, just like you're my mentee.
3,1,0,Do you think Barney will notice if I let go?
4,0,0,We're just taking the "three men in a room" concept to its logical conclusion.
3,1,0,It was HIS request to be buried in a brief case.
2,2,0,I express my individuality through my socks.
1,1,2,You know the judge is going to throw this case out.
4,0,0,Two thousand bucks for alpenhorn lessons and the only gigs I get are cough drop commercials.
4,0,0,So, we're agreed: One more team building exercise and we're out of here.
3,1,0,I think we are taking this car pooling thing a little too far.
5,0,0,Research shows a 20 percent decrease in hostility when they get massages before a layoff.
2,1,0,I'm the new Pedi-Uber.
5,0,0,The firm does not look favorably on rebellious, nonconformity such as you're showing right now.
3,1,0,Mr. Trump said to put his ego with his other baggage
4,0,0,This isn't working for me; I want to go back to having my own briefcase.
4,0,0,I know The Donald said it's just a prop he wants for tonight's debate, but I really think it's an anti-establishment rocket launcher.
0,4,1,This is so awesome. No one has any clue we're going golfing.
4,0,0,Tomorrow we go to your office, Frank.
5,0,0,Just follow my lead, and will land this gig.
4,0,0,The big warheads require three buttons.
5,0,0,Does our briefcase make my ass look big?
4,0,0,I'm sick of the sharing economy.
4,0,0,Are you feeling the Bern?

3,1,0,Are you saying it smells funny ha ha or funny peculiar?
3,1,0,I needed a right hand man.
3,0,1,Her purse looks big enough for a human head. Creepy.
4,0,0,Trump's loudness keeps him small endowed .These back up body parts are becoming heavier and heavier
2,2,0,These team building exercises are getting awkward.
3,1,0,We are making strides on ethnic diversity, but gender diversity still needs work...
4,0,0,The secret is whether this year's company Easter Bunny is dark or milk chocolate
3,1,0,This new job sharing policy is great.
5,0,0,We're team players.
3,0,0,Thanks for helping me bring my stuff to the trial today. It should be a brief case.
4,0,0,So this was the vise president's idea of collaboration!
4,0,0,It's a good thing Jim got his stomach stapled a couple years ago.
4,0,0,So, how exactly does brief case-pooling help the environment again?
2,1,1,I remember when bribes fit in a normal briefcase.
4,0,0,Do YOU have a license to carry?
3,1,0,This is the only threesome us charted accoutants will ever get.
4,0,0,Take this dead deal to the cemetery of the re-leased, re-poed, and retired.
4,1,0,You knew going in Earl - the conventions broken by three suited masseurs would ruffle some feathers.
5,0,0,I wish she would have released the emails before I joined the firm.
3,2,0,When we get to security, remember to act natural.
3,0,0,I'll debrief you two later.
2,1,1,One more mistake and you're off the case.
3,1,0,We bill in triplicate.
3,1,0,These forms are still required in triplicate.
4,1,0,We all need to be on the same side this meeting, Kevin.
3,0,0,Well ... we do the job of one.
5,0,0,Wait til you see the toilet.
4,0,0,Regardless whether the FIFO or LIFO rule applies in this instance, I still remain a ‘shmucko.’
3,0,0,No wonder everyone is sad the stock market crash and we are having another great depression.
2,2,0,Someday I hope to move to the first handle.
4,0,0,It's just great to feel a part of something.
5,0,0,This is my first triple-murder-case.
1,3,0,We really need to get in the same carpool.
3,1,0,This sharing economy thing is not all it's cracked up to be -- mind if we stop by the men's room on the way to the meeting?
4,0,0,Thanks for helping carry my lengthycase.
4,0,0,You're in the back because of seniority.
4,0,0,One of Trump's audits......its hugggeeeee!
5,0,0,I'm glad we didn't choose the four-handle briefcase.
3,0,1,Went well except for that subway turnstile.
4,0,0,Smithers, if we are to have a chance with this case, you have to get on the right side.
2,1,1,What do you want to bet its not the bonuses?
3,0,1,They said it was a three man job
4,0,0,You're sure this doesn't look suspicious?
4,0,0,Setting up across from that collapsed building should net us beaucoup lawsuits.
4,0,0,I don't think this 'All for one and one for all' is going to work
4,0,0,We'll all be happier when the plans for the new Triborough Bridge are made public."
4,0,0,We thought he said "cater to the BASS"
4,0,0,I wish they'd finally do away with the extra long form.
4,0,0,I thought it was rude how you called me a "stonehenge looking motherf*cker" in front of that lady. Actually, it was rude in general.
5,0,0,So you're the one on the other side of this case.
4,0,0,He gave his life to this company.
2,2,0,This would be a lot easier if we all worked on the same floor.
3,1,0,Well one of us should have remembered the combination.
3,0,1,I use this to carry giant squeeze packs of catsup and relish in case one of the IT guys brings another giant wiener for lunch.
4,0,0,My lunch is off limits.
4,0,0,Yes, but you're using your right hand.
3,2,0,TSA won't like this.
3,0,1,It's the 'team player' concept run amuck!
3,0,1,Be alert. There's a revolving door up ahead.
4,0,1,Must we take it so literally when a project is killed?
2,2,0,I can't wait until we can stop using the long forms.
4,0,0,No, this isn't the mile high club, and I have no desire to fly on your magic carpet.
2,1,1,Then I'll say, 'Your honor, this case is not brief.'
3,1,0,I think we left the xylophone in the car.
4,0,0,The era of Big Data.
2,0,1,This wasn't my idea of a triumvirate.
4,0,0,The client insists on a gold-plated defense.
4,0,0,Keep acting inconspicuously and they'll never notice it is missing.
4,0,0,Who are you working for?
4,1,0,Our work may get mixed up, but at least it can fit the entire hogie.
3,0,0,Open carry brainstorming sessions would be quicker
4,1,0,I told you panoramic selfies wouldn't fly.
4,1,0,The boss said we could make a case for bringing our kids to work.
4,0,0,Follow me; I lead from the middle.
4,0,0,Don't you think we're taking this whole carpool business just a bit to far?
4,0,0,So this is the guy from the February 22 cartoon. Wonder what happens to us after this week.
4,0,0,Who's idea was it to bring the not-so-brief case.
2,1,1,Next time, we buy one with wheels.
4,0,0,Look, it took Jenkins here, thirty years to get to the front of the bus.
3,1,0,That elevator was packed.
4,0,0,This way we're always cc'd.
4,0,0,We said three-briefing, Myles, not de-briefing.
4,0,0,Let's not take this diversity stuff too far, Jenkins.
4,0,0,Three's better than one, right?
2,1,0,I don't see how this promotes teamwork.
3,1,0,I forgot to cut air holes.
4,1,0,Louis Vuitton's latest
2,2,1,This is the company solution to force us to share a taxi.
4,0,0,I thought they'd like the Trinitarian symbolism.
3,1,0,This job sharing is becoming confining.
4,0,0,Your just wrong if your not on the right.
3,1,0,The boss is heavier than he looks.
4,0,0,It's so sad that he unincorporated.
4,0,0,This custom made laptop belongs to our very obese boss.
5,0,0,Same time next week?
4,0,0,At least this is half the work of that pallbearing gig.
4,0,0,Next week we're doing potluck.
4,0,0,Our legal briefs are longer than usual.
4,0,0,Try less shady.
3,1,0,Not that it's heavy, it's just awkward.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, folding clothes is a thing of the past.
3,1,0,Get over it Stevens...it's Johnson's turn to hold the front handle.
4,0,0,You've got to start pulling your weight around here, Jenkins.
4,0,1,So, what's the deal with your eyebrows?
2,2,0,I hate presenting to mortuaries.
4,0,0,It's a trick I learned when filing briefs for the NRA.
4,0,0,You can carry this without me, can't you?
3,0,1,Are you sure Joe wanted to be buried like this?
2,1,1,In my previous briefcase pool the other guys never pulled their weight.
3,2,0,We use this for office workers who die at their desk.
3,1,0,Remember, this is my lunch.
2,2,1,Next time, let's set the paper size to "Letter".
4,1,0,It's more of an attaché case.
4,0,0,Remember, it's a LAPStop.
3,2,0,This is a very big case for our law firm to be handling in this trial...
4,0,0,It is a pleasure and a honor to be a pall bearer of the terrorist rifle.
3,1,0,And you thought this would be a brief case?
4,0,0,"It's how he would have wanted ".
1,2,1,How do you screw up "three briefcases stuffed with cash?"
5,0,0,No I don't have Al Sharpton's number.
3,0,0,Welcome to the chain gang.
3,1,0,This merger has gone too far.
4,0,0,Count D. know you're moonlighting, day-shift dude?
2,1,1,'Buy three suits, get a briefcase' sounded good at the store.
3,2,0,I draw the line at the bathroom door.jg
1,3,0,This has to be the only opera with three offstage bassoons.
4,1,0,We should go for 'open carry.'
4,0,0,That woman may suspect something weird.
5,0,0,So the presentation was a bust. Why does the slide screen need an all-floors burial march?
4,0,0,We should have stopped at ride-sharing.
3,0,1,So what's it like in the right hand world?
4,0,0,You don't see our side of the case, do you?
2,0,2,I'm feeling redundant
5,0,0,The Boss wanted to be buried this way.
4,0,0,Why do women all react that way when I tell them we are professional pall bearers?
2,1,0,I really dread the subway ride.
4,0,0,So remember on the count of three....
5,0,0,Everyone's watching us carry this stupid box.
4,1,0,We're really a team now.
3,1,0,Hard to believe that I first resisted this idea.
4,0,0,Sorry Chad, we're looking for a man with slightly longer arms.
4,0,0,There's a landfill behind the office where we can bury this idea.
3,1,0,These days you never know who your delivering a Hero to.
4,0,0,You had to be the one to saw the girl in half, you had to be the big shot on this one. Now what are you going to tell her mother, and don't ask about super glue again.
2,2,0,You gotta wonder who has the time to read these long briefs.
4,0,0,Please stop calling me Lucky Pierre.
4,0,0,Lawyers live matter
4,0,0,Do you think the humans noticed our briefcase was a bit off?
3,0,1,Herb as the third black man it'll be your job to agree with everything Ron and I say.
4,0,0,Well, the boss is just keeping his promise to create jobs and promote diversity.
4,0,0,It's perfect for the extralegal size paper.
3,0,1,Stop worrying, she's not focused on our small hands...
4,0,0,Who are you that we should go to this length to accommodate your trust issues?
3,1,0,Welcome to the mergers and acquisition team!
3,2,0,Teamwork
3,1,0,Sure, we can leave him holding the bag. But my conscience will trouble me for a long long time.
4,0,1,Don't envy me. I had to perform despicable acts to move up to second handle.
3,1,0,Some lawyers use legal-sized paper. I prefer illegal.
4,0,0,If we act like it's a big idea, the client believes it's a big idea.
3,1,0,If a diamond-encrusted yardstick doesn’t impress them, nothing will.
2,2,0,This job sharing is going too far!
0,4,0,it's nice that we all work on the same floor.
5,0,0,Here at Dooley, Daniels and Dunne, we take job-sharing very seriously.
3,1,0,This way, each brief generates three times as many billable hours.
4,1,0,Why don't we just order out for a super hero sub like everyone else?
4,0,0,We've decided to decrease our digital footprint.
4,0,0,Well , we need a case this size . It's a Trumpet .
4,0,0,Who said they were briefs?
2,2,0,Have you guys heard any more about the downsizing?
2,2,0,Expect this briefing to run long.
4,0,0,We're here to massage the big Boss' ego
3,1,0,These audits are killing me.
4,0,0,Let's just hope they also don’t know what a Bassoon Trio really is.
3,1,0,We'll claim it as one carry-on.
4,0,1,Long story...
4,0,0,From where I stand you look like a leftist.
3,1,0,And we're the most normal guys here.
1,2,1,It is a rather lengthy brief.
4,1,0,Did you see the size of that lady's purse?
4,0,0,Bet you didn't think carrying around a keyboard in suits can make you popular with the ladies.
3,0,1,Slim deserved a better send off
5,0,0,Relax ! It's a lot better than a body bag.
3,0,1,We graduated from Trump University.
3,1,0,This sharing economy has gone too far.
3,1,0,How do you think she guessed we work at a surfboard company?
4,0,0,Tell Mr Trump his prosthesis body part has arrived.
3,1,0,Just my luck I have to share a briefcase with a cyclops and a guy with yogurt-covered raisins for eyes.
4,0,0,Saul over at Rossford Inc. tells me his company is just beginning THEIR merger.
3,1,0,Corporate thinks our jobs are redundant.
3,1,0,You're the one who complained about your caseload.
4,0,0,I think that you're the one who's a team player, after all.
4,0,0,Remember, I have front handle at pretrial.
4,0,0,Wait till you see what the team building experts have done with the toilets.
4,0,0,Legal size is back--with a vengeance!
4,0,0,At least she didn't ask us about the weather.
2,2,0,We don't need an *actual* ladder to get promoted.
3,0,0,I haven't been this amazed since finding out Mark Wahlberg had a third nipple.
5,0,0,I anticipate a real long session today. So I left my brief case at home.
3,1,0,It's not an open and shut case.
4,1,0,Are you sure we shouldn't look inside before we bury this overly large briefcase in the desert?
3,1,0,'Team building's OK, but this is ridiculous.'
2,1,1,Have you ever been to a mortician's board meeting?
3,1,0,I played bass for 'The Who'.
3,1,0,Boss likes his bonus in small, unmarked bills.
3,1,0,Do you think our brief is too long?
3,1,0,Sure, it's a big guitar, but it is worth it.
3,0,1,The client prefers everything in triplicate.
4,0,0,Are you ready to play the long game?
4,0,0,I am 100% sure that what we are doing matches the term "sharing revenue".
3,1,0,We'll call it the not so briefcase.
4,0,0,I don't think Donald is holding up his end.
3,0,0,What's your favorite position?
4,0,0,Don't you think the sharing economy has gone a bit too far?
2,1,0,The lawyers made us do it.
3,1,0,We've got a long case ahead of us.
3,0,0,This is really taking team building to another level.
5,0,0,I get the need for cost-cutting, but this is going a bit far.
5,0,0,Remember, we take no questions until after the fat lady sings.
5,0,0,How I miss having hundred dollar bills...
4,0,0,I always wondered why they're usually kept so brief.
4,0,0,I sure miss the days when we had our own BRIEFcases ...
4,0,0,I thought a "happy ending" would really boost company morale.
4,0,0,This arrived right after the executive team building workshop.
4,0,0,In this case it's all about bonding.
2,1,0,I told you that it would be a long, drawn out, legal process...
4,0,0,All for one and one for all.
4,1,0,I hate this new IRS Long Form.
4,0,0,I told the judge it wouldn't take long and there was only one page of women's signatures, claiming sexual abuse.
4,1,0,I felt you'd take that side of the case.
4,1,0,I knew we'd find a way to carry this case forward.
3,1,0,It's the new teamwork model for lawyers........
4,0,0,I don't like this cheap airfare practice of having to deliver the luggage of others. Especially with the random assignment of passengers to help with the delivery.
4,0,0,What could I say? He insists that he can dazzle the shareholders with how well he can play 'Stairway to Heaven' on his electric guitar
3,0,1,The airline charges for each carry on.
3,1,0,I hope you don't have any vacation plans, Harris. This is gonna be a long case.
4,0,0,I've gotta pee.
3,0,1,I think we lost because we haven't mastered brief writing.
5,0,0,I have a handle on the case.
3,1,0,I still think we would have less conspicuous carrying pistols in shoulder holsters.
4,0,0,This must be the longest report they've ever put together.
4,1,0,After we slam the briefcase on his desk ...
5,0,0,It's how we maintain a full disclosure at the office.
0,3,1,Is this your first big case?
1,3,0,Now, you're sure they insisted on the long-form contract?
4,0,0,I still say he wanted a three piece suit.
3,0,1,Team building sucks.
3,2,0,On the contrary, I thought there was just the right amount of humour in our presentation.
4,0,0,Yes. Literally, steamrolled. (ED:Please italicize "Literally"-can't do on my computer)
4,0,0,Remember when machine guns used to fit inside violin cases?
2,2,0,Maybe it makes our hands look small, but it definitely makes our briefs look better.
4,1,0,Really, guys, does President Trump's wig case really need a Secret Service detail?
3,1,0,Car pooling was bad enough but this is emasculating.
1,2,1,It's the terms AND the conditions
4,0,0,It's horizontally integrated manufacturing.
4,0,0,You get a lot of stares when you're a pool cue salesman.
3,1,0,I don't know about you, having three guys carry a trunk out of a government building, I'm getting out before Trump gets here.
3,0,1,How likely is it that they'll let us put this overhead carrier in the overhead carrier?
3,1,0,Do you think the jury will realize this is a really big case we are trying?
2,2,0,Just act nonchalant.
2,1,1,Glad you could join the firm. We needed a third hand,
4,0,0,I'm NOT sharing credit for this.
3,1,0,Let's hope third time's the charm.
4,0,0,And the Devil makes three.
4,0,0,I told you it wouldn't stop at sharing an office.
4,0,0,I've heard of taking your work home with you, but this is ridiculous.
4,0,0,Lucky I didn't press twelve.
4,0,0,I'm firing our efficiency expert.
2,2,0,The knocking is going to give us away.
4,0,0,Shhh-- we chopped up the boss into teeny, tiny pieces.
3,0,0,We're taking this 'consensus' thing a bit too far, don't you think?
2,1,1,Geez, Talk About a Merger...
4,1,0,At the last place I worked we just voted the CEO out.
2,1,1,Did you see that strange lady on the elevator?
3,1,0,He groaned at the CEO's jokes.
2,1,0,Quiet. No one will suspect anything.
4,0,0,It's the final step before wall-less cubicles.
3,0,0,This was the briefest case they had.
4,1,0,I'm all for sharing the litigation workload, but this.......

4,0,0,The Smith sextuplets had to take the stairs
3,1,0,Small hands? Large briefcase.
2,2,0,Well why not, we car pool don't we?
2,1,0,It may be long, but it still identifies as brief.
4,1,0,Looks like another failed urinal presentation.
4,0,0,''Wish I was briefed first.''
4,0,0,The last remains of traceability in default swaps.
2,0,2,You know, I could just let go.
4,0,0,The client asked to see our experience with horizontal integration.

5,0,0,You want the Flying Magic Yoga next door.
4,0,0,Did you ask if they would take a check?
4,0,0,The mortician said I was crazy, but the carpool lane changes everything.
3,1,0,This is gonna be a long meeting.
4,0,0,These ten year plans are a real back breaker.
2,2,0,We're in this together, right?
2,0,2,This is a long held secret.
4,0,0,No, this isn't the nuclear football. This briefcase is for the presidential steaks.
4,1,0,I'm trying to disguise my viola as an AK-47.
4,0,0,These stand-up comedian funerals are easier on the back.
1,1,1,It's good to see that they aren't trying to cut the middleman out of every transaction.
2,2,0,Escalators and stairs are a bit more challenging.

5,0,0,I'm pushing it down.
4,0,0,Personally, I would have shredded the documents, but they've already dug the hole.

4,0,0,What happened to Chance.
3,1,0,I told you it wouldn't fit in the overhead rack.
5,0,0,2000 plus emails are really weighty! Do you think we can bury them without the FBI finding out?
4,0,0,When will the boss' obsession for baguettes come to an end?
3,1,0,I said to bring everything just in case... NOT in just ONE case!
4,0,0,I hope they didn't put onions on this super-size pizza.
5,0,0,We thought YOU were carrying the rest of the instruments.
3,1,0,Luck of the draw, I guess.
4,0,0,He wasn't joking when he said the case was loaded.
5,0,0,You know what they say about men with long briefcases----They have long dic-tations.
3,1,0,Try to keep up.
3,1,1,You think the prosecution is prepared for a lengthy case?
3,1,0,Don't you feel the synergy?
4,1,0,You'll never make partner like that, Jenkins.
4,0,0,I still haven't gotten used to the merger.
4,0,0,Told you he'd fit if we chopped him up.
2,2,0,I hope you put your name on your lunch.
3,0,1,Is being on the Left a political statement?
4,0,0,And I thought car pooling was inconvenient.
3,1,0,I'll take it odd days; you two split the rest.
4,0,0,Trust me, I get that look a lot.
4,0,0,With three you get egg roll.
3,0,1,This is how we smuggle putters into our office.
0,3,0,This is the worst case scenario.

4,0,0,These catering tables are useless at the anorexia conference.
1,2,1,Remember when we used to get our OWN briefcases?
3,1,0,Ironically, the brief is actually quite short.
3,1,0,Boy, if she only knew we are "Super Glued" to these handles!
4,0,0,Must you always order the giant burrito?
3,1,1,There really is an Uber for everything now.
2,2,0,OK, the first thing you need to know is that Ted was a leftie.
4,1,0,Artie always said, 'I'll probably die behind my desk!'
4,0,0,I still think the brief for this case is a little wordy.
3,0,1,They're going to shred it and spread the ashes across the Pacific.
4,0,0,When I look in the mirror...I see a reflection of someone else's face.
4,0,0,Its a big case, that's why we need three lawyers on it!
4,0,0,Did you notice? Bill wasn't pedaling at company speed this morning.
4,0,0,Is this what they mean by diseconomies of scale?

3,0,0,I hate it when he gets the six foot sub.
3,1,0,I'm not sure that "brief" is exactly the right word.
3,1,0,It's the sharing economy, stupid.
3,1,0,You were told when you joined the firm -- we only handle big cases.
4,0,0,You realise, with this we are redefining the definition of "brief"!
3,1,0,This brings 'working in tandem' to a whole new level.
4,0,0,I love our carpool. I guess I just need more "me" time.
0,2,3,I want you off the case.
2,3,0,Do you think we're taking this car-pooling thing too far?
4,0,0,Dude... I'm so sorry your keyboard died.
4,0,0,Once the overture begins, you'll have to take turns sitting on my lap.
3,1,0,Somehow, I don't think UberBriefcase is going to catch on.
5,0,0,That restaurant had a strange way of packaging Fred's to-go salad, huh?
3,1,0,We couldn't have chosen a *brief*case?

2,3,0,I remember when they used to call these "brief" cases?
3,1,0,I love this new team building exercise.
2,1,1,Do you remember the procedure for when I need to switch hands?
2,2,0,The trickiest part is reversing into elevators.
3,1,0,Well that was the longest divorce we’ve ever settled.
4,0,0,This thing is perfect for our "board" meeting"

5,0,0,We'd be more balanced, if I was an Asian woman.
1,2,2,Time to admit this is the worst case scenario.
4,0,0,We forgot our lunch.
4,0,0,I'm not vulnerable, the IT dept. warned me about your man-in-the-middle attack, they said I'm protected. Must be that blond back there.

4,0,0,Man, these power lunches are getting longer, and longer and longer.
3,2,0,He wanted to die the way he lived.
4,0,0,Remember this is a hostile takeover. If there Board of Directors resits, we take out our weapons and shoot them!
3,1,0,Just follow us.
2,2,0,I trust the pen is in here this time.
3,1,0,It's important you get on the RIGHT side of the sharing economy
2,1,1,You're right-handed, kid. No way you could ever be #2.
3,1,0,Consider us as the three wise men reincarnated.
1,2,1,Ever thought of getting your own briefcase?.
4,0,0,$349 is a bargain for a 4 foot hoagie when they throw in the executive carry-out option.
4,0,0,It's the new triple secure delivery.
3,1,0,"Wanna see 'no hands' again?
5,0,0,You need a yoga mat not a flying carpet.
3,1,0,I think we need a coxswain.
5,0,0,Can I take my work home alone?
4,0,0,I still wish we could afford an editor.
4,1,0,Remember to kill the conference room lights right when I go into my solo.

3,0,0,Let's open with "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida".
3,1,0,I think you're coming with us.
3,1,0,Well this case sure isn’t brief…
4,0,0,The "shareconomy's" next big star: BRIEFER
4,0,0,It's all very scientific. For creativity, it's left hands, controlling the right side of the suitcase.
2,2,0,Whose turn was it to bring lunch today?
4,0,0,Many hands makes for clumsy work
4,0,0,So, we're going with three pool cues, yeah?
2,1,0,I know, but it was either this or just an iPad.
3,0,1,Let's see what she does if we drop this and run.
4,0,0,This takes brotherhood to a whole new level.
4,1,0,We're trying to blend with the crowd ... so get that dumb look off your face!
4,0,0,I'm worried. The judge made it clear he opposes long cases.
3,1,0,Five dollar footlong.
3,2,0,I've got to take up a smaller instrument.
3,0,1,There's nothing brief about this case.
4,0,0,Now that we're no longer conjoined, can we get separate briefcases?
4,0,0,I think we should have left it at car pooling.
4,0,0,I don't care what the boss says, this Three Man Briefcase is a ridiculous idea!!!
5,0,0,You being the new guy, I think it only fair to inform you, that as soon as we turn into the office, a struggle for possession might ensue which could, and sometimes does, result in violence and I have a third degree brown belt in karate.
4,0,1,Even though the boss says, believe him, there's no problem, we've been asked to present photos.
3,0,0,Chill. There is no "I" in attache case.
4,0,0,These filibuster statements are killers.
3,1,0,you are on the wrong side again!
2,1,1,Got enough air in there?

3,2,0,We've got a handle on this.
3,1,0,I told you the boss had big plans for us.

4,0,0,Forget the ergonomic benefits, this has a real fun factor!
3,1,0,So let me get this straight...the last one still holding on by the end of the week get's the window office?
4,0,0,If at first you don't succeed, Tri, Tri, Tri again.
4,0,0,"Paperwork consolidation," my ass.
3,1,0,Ok , technically yes, this could be a threesome.
5,0,0,And they said the Xylophone Pro wouldn't have commercial applications!
3,1,0,Yes, I am the middle man and I say we should have gone one floor up.
1,1,2,It took only one lawyer and was called a "briefcase"
3,1,0,I found another briefcase pool that fits my schedule better. It's nothing personal.
4,0,0,It's what we get for working in the antonym department.
3,1,0,I sense some distrust in these merger negotiations.
2,2,0,Accounting insisted we file the long form this year.
3,1,0,This car pooling thing is getting out of hand.
2,0,1,I'll be so glad when the jury comes back on this nasty faulty ironing board liability case!
4,0,0,This is the left-handed floor.
3,0,2,"If the case is brief, there's no relief." Johnny Cochran taught me that.
4,0,0,Why did we all share one luggage?
3,1,0,Okay, next week is your turn to be the middleman.
3,0,1,Briefcase-Pooling
4,0,0,And who was the brainiac who kept insisting that the concept just needed a little massaging?
4,0,0,People think it's easy transporting Trump's hair care products.
3,0,1,I carry you two.
2,1,1,You sure you saw this in GQ?
4,0,0,Trust me - if accounting knows we have a 6-foot sub we'll never get rid of them
3,0,1,Listen up, we first say, 'Boss, we have a new Stradivarius', and then we open fire.
5,0,0,They did warn me it was going to be a long case.
2,2,0,I apparently didn’t read the fine print of the RideShare program.
4,0,0,You call it a football?
3,1,0,Carry-on can be a problem
2,0,2,I use to lose my briefcase all the time until I hired you guys.
3,1,0,Just act natural.
2,2,0,There's collaboration, and then there's codependence.
4,0,0,We'll have to add another handle for gender equality.
4,0,0,I honestly don't think this is what a long brief is supposed to be
1,3,0,You need to carry your weight.

4,1,0,Just wait until you see the restroom.
5,0,0,Think of it as a final resting place for good ideas.
4,0,0,Small hands!
4,0,0,Do you think she could smell what's in the briefcase?
3,1,0,The preferred term is 'middle person'.
3,2,0,Golf clubs, maybe?
4,0,1,I think we've taken car pooling a little too far.
2,1,1,They're the XL files.
3,1,0,I'm afraid the firm's experiment with six-foot legal pads is not turning out the way we'd hoped.
1,3,0,And that's how I made it to middle management.
4,0,0,It's bad enough Mr. Trump had this commissioned to illustrate his manhood. Does he really need to make us lug it to all the debates???
4,0,0,I like to call it a griefcase
2,2,0,I'm not sure this is what Corporate meant by consolidating departments.
2,2,0,Not every case is brief.
3,1,0,Welcome to the major case team
4,0,0,This goes right along with our new "open concept" office design.
3,1,0,Why must you always be on the left?
4,0,0,Lunch?
4,0,0,At least we didn't share a bed.
3,1,0,We really should switch to legal size paper.
4,0,0,My wife wasn't happy when I told her we were job sharing again this weekend.
4,0,0,It's been a long case.
3,1,0,Sometimes the most unexpected people tend to help you in rare occasions.
2,2,0,Good idea not bringing the 4th guy, we'd have looked pretty silly.
4,0,0,its like we practiced....1,2,3....1,2,3
4,0,0,Is it heavy? I'm just faking it.
4,1,0,Your wife seems happy we're bringing work home.
4,1,0,It's as if we were attachéd at the hip.
4,0,0,I know the boss wants synergy, but come on...
4,0,0,My new phone has the biggest screen ever and a three man carry case to go with it. Its like having a tv in the palm of your hand.
4,0,0,I am the next coming of Christ.
2,1,1,If anyone asks, just say it's a long story.
4,0,0,It took Jenkins there ten years, but he made it to head intern.
4,0,0,Actually, getting to carry "The Big Briefcase" is considered quite an honor!
4,0,0,Wait! Where's our lunchbox?
4,0,0,Someday I hope to work my way up to first handle.
3,1,0,No one needs to know we are working together.
2,1,0,This meeting calls for the verbosecase.
4,0,0,We need to table this!
4,0,0,Job sharing won't be a good sell, let's go with XP - Extreme presenting.
4,1,0,All this technology and we still have to do everything in triplicate.
4,0,0,You;ll get your own briefcase when you get your own key to the men's room.
3,1,0,It's a bobsled.

4,0,0,Separate attaches just didn't make sense.
4,0,0,No, don't open with 'next stop, the East River.'
3,0,1,Les Paul bearers.
3,1,0,I wonder why the wives were so upset this morning.
4,1,0,Next time, I call shotgun.

3,1,0,I call shotgun
4,0,0,These austerity measures are getting to be a bit much.
3,1,0,Sharing is caring.
5,0,0,"I" know we are triplets, and "I" know your triplet briefcase is a great idea, but trust me on this, the only chance we have to impress those "Jump the Shark" entrepreneurs is to walk in unison on the same side.
4,1,0,I don't know, but I've been TOLLLDDD...
2,1,1,It gets us in the cafeteria HOV line.

3,1,0,This is the longest presentation we've ever done.
4,0,0,Microsoft Word upgraded their 'merge documents' tool.
4,0,0,His wife wanted it this way. She said to keep the embellishments on the coffin as brief as possible.
3,2,0,And someday, if YOU make all the sacrifices necessary to reach the top of the lackey's ladder, YOU'LL get to grab the middle handle.
1,2,0,You get used to it after you've been job sharing a while.
4,0,0,Twice the clothes and half the money.
4,0,0,You know I was in the middle seat on the flight too.
4,0,0,Just my luck: I always get the middle handle.
4,0,1,The hard part was folding him to fit inside.
4,0,0,Did you remember to pack our tooth brush?
4,0,0,I don't care if we are triplets! I want my own briefcase!
3,1,0,Before I was in Cream, I had to carry it myself.
4,0,0,When the boss said he wanted three of us on the case I didn’t think this is what he had in mind.
4,0,0,Well, this case won't be brief.
5,0,0,Not what I had in mind when I suggested job sharing.
3,1,0,I know we saved on the airport luggage fee but don't you think it's time we each got our own travel bag?

3,1,0,We're filing a long brief.
2,2,0,It adds weight to our recommendations, and we charge more. Remember, don't smile.
5,0,0,Now I know how they're able to keep revising the previous month's new job figures upwards.
4,0,0,It'll be days before they realize George is missing.
4,0,0,Which gun did you bring this time??
4,0,0,Just between you and me, I’m not completely sure a suitcase full of old bricks is the Next Big Thing.
3,1,0,The court won't allow separate briefs.
2,2,0,He was wrong about being carried out of here in a pine box
3,1,0,Does holding this section of our bag make me look gay?
3,1,0,I just don't like representing shallow people.
3,1,0,We carpool, we merged briefcases and you're still not sharing your feelings. Damn it Fred, let me in.
3,1,0,For a man with such small hands, he certainly has large briefs.
4,1,0,Again!?!
1,2,1,Do we really have to disclose how many people it takes to change these fluorescent bulbs?
4,0,0,n "No one suspects that it's an ironing board.

3,1,0,It would look funny if there were two of us carrying a briefcase.
3,1,0,I wish they would stop talking about team spirit.
4,0,0,It's time you both pull your own weights.
4,1,0,It's your turn to have coffee.
4,0,0,This merger is a real pain in the...
4,0,0,So is that supposed to pique my curiosity, or is it supposed to make you seem interesting?
3,0,1,This time, I'll be Larry, he'll be Moe, and you can be Curly.
3,1,0,If they hire one of us, they have to hire all of us.
3,2,0,I'm starting to rethink this briefcase pooling idea.
4,0,0,Corporate might be taking this ride share thing a little too far.
4,0,0,It demonstrates that we share the weight fairly.
2,0,2,I've never been comfortable with the way we get rid of nosy interns.
4,0,0,He said put the money in the suitcase so we had to have it custom made
1,3,1,You're on the wrong side of the case.
3,1,0,People keep pushing and pushing the sexual envelop.
3,0,1,It's an honor to be pallbearer for the latest budget killed by the board.
2,2,1,So, for lunch—the five-foot hoagie, and we’ll sit on the sofa?
4,0,0,It lets us bill three times the usual amount.
3,0,1,Legal briefs keep getting longer.
4,1,0,On the other hand, I really think we should have separate toilets.

4,0,0,Let's keep this case civil, Ricardo.
3,0,1,Slim wanted to be buried from the office.
4,0,0,I’m so relieved it was a closed briefcase ceremony. The client would have wanted it that way.
4,1,0,Token rightie
4,0,0,Is this your first time as a pallbearer?
3,0,1,when "When we hit the men's room , who's letting go first?
4,0,0,Sir, was that you that just emitted gas from your anus?" "Nah man, that was the lady behind us...
4,0,0,Remember "Carlito's Way"?

3,1,0,I never bring a knife to a boardroom fight.
4,0,0,A new bromance has formed.
3,1,0,Okay, when we get into the interview-- just remember, we're one person.
3,1,0,When is Charlie going to start carrying his own weight?
4,0,0,What do you think management meant about us needing to cut out all the middle-men?
4,0,0,Where do we put the body?
2,2,0,At the interview, remind them that we also carpool
2,1,0,I take it you clicked the service agreement without reading it, too?
4,0,0,I know they weren't specific, but I think they meant bring your live kid to work day
4,1,0,These board meetings get any longer we're going to need more help.
4,0,0,Your 'brief ' is heavier than I thought.
3,1,0,Trust me. No one will notice.
4,0,0,There's letter size, there's legal size, but the real money is in tabloid size.
4,0,0,She said, 'Wake me up when the hairdresser arrives.'
4,0,0,Undertakers: Beware the Ides of March !! Underpaid doctors can "undertake" new moonlighting jobs ...
4,0,0,Remember, if we get sexually harassed today, it's my turn.
4,0,0,I think the long and short of it is that we lost the case!
3,0,1,We're anticipating a long trial.
1,3,0,I don't think this is how file sharing works.
4,0,1,You can't stay on that side in the bathroom.
4,0,1,I hate being the bearer of bad news.
2,2,0,Don't forget to mention our work for the Trilateral Commission.
4,0,1,This guy thinks he's going to get away with one tip?
5,0,0,Sorry, but Tailgate Yoga class is Saturday afternoon.

3,1,0,They told me to bring along that big dummy
5,0,0,The original Snap, Crackle and Pop at corporate headquarters in Battle Creek
3,1,0,Something tells me our project is DOA.
4,0,0,Evidently getting run over by a steamroller requires only three pallbearers.
4,0,0,Your lunch is weighing me down.
4,1,0,We're taking this teamwork thing to the extremes...
4,0,0,I really think we should think about going back to shorter legal pads.
3,1,1,Remember, now, we never disagree.
4,0,0,What's the expected repair date for that paper cutter?
3,0,0,It was marketed as a mobile collaboration system.
4,1,0,Your meeting is in our other building?
4,0,0,His gloves aren't small.
4,0,0,I heard it's the new EZ form.
3,2,0,The new Office Supply Manager's name is Paul Bearer.
4,0,1,We'll dump him in the river.
3,0,1,You're sure they said actual boiler plate.
4,0,0,The lawyers of Tusk, Tusk, and Trunk were always easy to spot walking into the office.
4,1,0,I picked the right side, Johnson. You're getting left behind.
4,0,0,I still think this is a strange team-building exercise.
4,0,0,I'm also going to need your help in the men's room.
3,1,0,Do you think we might be pushing this whole "team thing" a bit too far?
3,1,0,It's either Trump's hair, or the wall. We haven't quite figured it out yet
2,1,1,But we just went to the bathroom.
4,0,0,The big bass trio arrives for their evening gig.
3,0,0,Here comes a right turn, two steps for every one I take.
4,0,0,So you promise me this can stop Trump?
4,1,0,"Remember when we thought hot-desking was tough".
4,1,0,So you're SURE this is Eco-friendly?
3,0,1,Do you think this deposition might be too long?
4,0,0,Did you have to tell her we carry our 'briefs' in here?
4,0,0,Team-building Tuesday is really making me hate both of you.
1,2,1,Don't worry, our presentation is too big to fail.
4,0,0,Why do you always get to handle the light weight, Jerry?
4,0,0,I doubt we'll ever be asked to be pallbearers again.
4,0,0,Because his will specified the mail delivery tube, but he wouldn't fit
3,1,1,Going to open the meeting with your man walks into a "board" joke again, Phillips?
4,0,0,You do realize i have not been helping you guys carry this thing since i'm in the middle
3,1,0,It definitely qualifies as carried-interest.
4,0,0,When the boss said to bury the project, I didn't realize he meant literally.
4,0,0,She asked for a three-way.
4,0,0,They just call it a "brief".
4,0,0,I'll admit it: I had my doubts about the new synergy initiative.
4,0,0,They said I was joining a team with upward mobility.
3,0,0,We'd take up less space if you used your left hand.
4,0,0,Does this remind you of the song about the marching ants?
5,0,0,That's how we decided to go in the opposite direction of the paperless company.
4,0,0,What do you say we leave this one here in purgatory?
5,0,0,Perhaps, this can be a great optic to convey that our team approach didn't work.
4,0,0,why is everyone looking at us ? its just a large box (with goodies) from our office "run don't walk"
4,0,0,Three-piece suits are "out," but the triple briefcase will always be "in."
3,1,0,I get to go first next time
4,0,0,Are you sure this is what they meant by 'meeting with the brass?'
3,1,0,It's from the Diversity Compliance toolbox.
1,2,0,I never understood purses.
4,0,0,Is it me, or do these payments keep getting bigger?
3,0,0,Now, we'll see who REALLY got the job!
5,0,0,Remember, all for one, one for all.
3,2,0,I was afraid he might get carried away.
3,0,1,Don't bring a knife to a gunfight.
4,0,0,So were are the dream team, is that it?
3,0,0,Really...how many guys does it take to carry his "Make America Great Again" caps?
4,0,0,I don't think you can fit in
4,0,0,This ought to be the full body of evidence.
3,1,0,Remember, you're the back-up to the back-up.
3,1,0,I hate being the middleman.
3,0,1,It's just as Vita requested . I stuffed her pockets full of rocks and now we're going to drop her and the cats in the East River.
1,3,0,Cut it out, Johnson. Brakemen don't steer.
2,2,0,I told you this litigation case was huge.
1,2,1,The boss got this "team" idea while attending a funeral.
4,0,0,I'm wonder what our hotel room is going to be like? Weird business trip.
3,1,0,Negotiations will be short once they see it's written in stone.
4,0,0,Remember, speak softly.
4,1,0,Giving out happy endings again, Williams?
4,0,0,I'm not sure about Dropbox getting into hardware either.
3,0,1,I understand you name is Trey.
4,0,0,Are you sure we aren't taking the merger too literal?
3,1,0,I don't think anyone will know we have a keyboard in here.
4,0,0,"I still don't know how my transfer is going to work".
4,0,0,What's the opposite of "merger"?
3,1,0,Yes Bentley, that was a long brief.
4,0,0,This time we pass by the men's room before the handcuffs, ok?
3,1,1,We never speak of this again..
5,0,0,He always wanted to go quietly.
3,2,0,We may have to screw in a lightbulb as well.
4,0,0,Red dot special
3,1,0,It's all about that bass.
2,2,0,Our Company is certainly big enough to afford a permanent conference table.
3,1,0,He would have wanted an ergonomic funeral.
4,0,0,Mr. Trump said something about needing it for his huge briefs.
4,0,0,I also hate the long hours.
3,0,0,I know we carpool - but this is a little to far.
4,0,0,I think our presentation may be a bit long.
3,1,0,Just once can't you side with me on a case?
4,0,0,This will stop them from talking about our small hands!
4,0,0,Is it me? Or were those guys acting kind of Neanderthal?
4,0,0,Timeshare gone too far.
4,1,0,Big case, huh?
3,0,1,Remember when suits came with two pairs of pants?
3,0,0,Remember if the police walk by, act natural.
5,0,0,This is embarrassing. I wish he'd get his eyes checked.
3,1,0,By the way, I won't see you guys next Monday. I'm taking the backpack.
4,0,0,We started out just sharing a cubicle.
4,0,0,It's a joint-custody case.
4,0,0,Who knew that "teamwork" meant sharing a briefcase?
3,1,0,You are right. This does make me feel more important.
4,0,0,Yeah, just in time to catch the final four.
4,1,0,You think the paperwork is bad.
3,1,0,Unlocking the i-briefcase; this'll be good.
4,0,0,We all carry our weight around here.
2,2,0,It's a really big account.
3,1,0,Fred and I feel you're not carrying your share of the load.
4,0,0,Like we could ever forget you were winning coxswain at the Head of the Charles?
3,1,0,I get front on the way back.
3,1,0,I thought that went well except for the "casket of the future" crack.
4,0,0,legal sized paper...
3,0,1,When the boss said we were the perfect lawyers to handle a long case, I thought he meant a trial!
4,0,0,My writing style is effective.
4,0,0,He looked fine yesterday.......
4,0,0,There's also a 'boxer' model.
4,0,0,This time, you have got to hold up your end.
4,0,0,The Three Lawyers are going to be BIG!
4,1,0,Do you think we can get this guy through security?
4,1,0,Well, it's lighter than a coffin.
4,0,0,Why do they keep calling us the "Trump Triplets?"
4,1,0,Brief (?) case.
4,0,0,Something tells me this trial may be a rather lengthy affair.
2,0,2,He says 'coming about', you shift to the starboard side.
4,1,0,Any thoughts on how we'll split the commission?
5,0,0,I guess I misunderstood the term "Case Managers."
3,1,0,They're not BRIEF case briefs.
5,0,0,The agency is big on portmanteau words.
5,0,0,How the Mob disposes of Graft Paper.
4,0,0,Make sure Mr. Trumps wigs are cleaned and combed before he makes his speech.
4,1,0,I miss being a Pallbearer but prefer working indoors.
4,0,0,Wrong Side, Wrong Hair, Don't give me that look!
1,2,1,Because CPA's don't have roadies, thats why
4,0,0,That's what she said!
5,0,0,when a board meeting feels like your going to a funeral
3,1,0,You call yourself a coxswain?
2,2,0,"Brief" case my ass.
5,0,0,I'm finally getting the hang of this group briefing thing.
3,1,0,I don't know how he always gets to work before we do.
4,0,0,Perchance, did you prepare the slides on redundancy?
2,2,0,Joe, my last day is Friday. I'm tired of being the middle man.
3,1,0,This is a two man job, new guy. Watch your back.
3,1,0,This 'sharing economy' thing is getting ridiculous.
4,0,0,I really appreciate you for being a pallbearer for my portfolio.
3,1,0,It's bad enough we have to share an office, but do we have to share everything?
4,0,0,Next time we should go for the premium file-sharing service.
4,0,0,Your resume says you're ambidextrous.
3,1,0,She really just doesn't have a handle on our case.
1,2,1,I don't know. I'm just the middle man.
2,1,1,An MBA is useful, but rowing team experience is essential.
4,0,0,Just try to blend in.
5,0,0,They called it a merger;but I never thought they give us one briefcase too work out of.
5,0,0,So I said, "Why do cases need to be *brief*? Why not a *long*case?"
4,0,0,Thanks for helping me with my new tablet.
3,1,0,If you were a team player you'd have my back right now.
4,1,0,One day robots will make this briefcase with only one handle.
4,0,0,So how do you like mortuary school so far?
4,1,0,Act natural.
1,3,1,What if only one of us gets the job
3,2,0,This is last time I ask the partners for help with my caseload.
4,0,0,You're offsides
3,1,0,Ashes require fewer pall bearers.
4,0,0,Of course you matter. Look, Johnson will walk first into the next lift, and then you can have the front of the briefcase.
3,1,0,The Academy really expanded the number of nominees this year
5,0,0,You're not lifting.
2,1,1,It's the corporate ladder.
4,0,0,Parker ordered it when he heard the new CEO was into threesomes.
4,0,0,This is my fetish.
4,0,0,At least we're not carrying a tuba.
4,0,0,The law firm of Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.
4,0,0,It's our "Show & Tell" demonstration. Not surprising that White House staff have not seen a bazooka up close and personal.
2,1,1,I love the new suitcase pool.
4,0,0,Maybe we've taken this sharing economy thing too far?
4,0,0,Your eyeball is sticking out.
4,0,0,Tech industry...pffft! The luggage industry is what makes this country great...
4,0,0,The whiteboard died.
2,2,0,You'll find, at this level, that 'brief ' takes on a whole other meaning.
4,0,0,What do you suppose the boss wants with this organization chart?
4,1,0,I hate being conjoined at the toe.
2,1,1,I preferred it when we could just fire a guy.
3,1,0,Next time I want to lead
4,0,0,Eyestrain will hit you bad by the third hour of staring at spreadsheets, but at least in this chain gang, there’s no shackle sores.
4,1,0,Two's a company, but three's a crowdsource.
4,0,0,First carpooling, now this. The environmentalists are getting extreme.
4,0,0,Trump illegal?
4,0,0,What are you looking at? You've never seen a man with a briefcase?
3,2,0,I really hope they see the big picture.
5,0,0,Why do we always ask for treble damages?
4,0,0,A traditional coffin might look pretty, but this is so much lighter!
3,1,0,I was a middle child
3,0,0,Just follow our lead.
5,0,0,Just follow his lead and try to keep up.
4,0,0,I appreciate Big Data, I'm just not sure how to carry it.
3,1,0,I still have problems with the common bedroom.
4,1,0,McMullen and I can handle this ourselves.
4,0,0,You'll be my pallbearers when I'm terminated.
2,3,0,This job-sharing policy has gone a bit too far.
4,0,0,That went well, don't we think?
3,1,0,Carpooling is one one thing, but this is ridiculous!
3,1,0,She acts like she's never seen guys share a briefcase before.
1,3,0,Sorry you have to deal with my baggage.
4,0,0,This is exactly what they meant by work share.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, when they ask us to play, don't go ape on me again........
3,1,0,I expected more from a "Partnership"
3,1,0,I suppose you also want to cut out the middle man.
2,0,1,How do you always keep your end up?
4,0,0,I'm telling you this not so brief case will sell in the millions.
5,0,0,If they ever ask what's in the case, it's closed.
2,1,1,This is where it always gets awkward.
4,0,0,I've always preferred the attache style.
3,1,0,I think Larry is taking our equal partnership agreement a little too far.
4,0,0,I don't think it's sufficiently brief.
3,1,0,There's no turning back now.
4,1,0,Now that all agents must have tiny hands it takes three to carry the nuclear briefcase.
5,0,0,Don't worry-it is our second amendment right
3,1,0,“Today are we Stooges, Bears, or Musketeers?
4,0,0,I think the report stretches the truth a bit much myself. We were one small fib away from not fitting in the elevator.
3,1,0,Your tie is making people stare.
3,1,0,When you said oversight, I was thinking more like ankle monitor.
4,0,0,He brought in his personal water board from home.
1,2,1,How long do you think we have before they notice our boss is missing?
3,1,0,You were right, this is the easiest way to remove an interloper from a Trump rally.
4,1,0,Do we have to be on the same team again?
4,0,0,Next time, let's demonstrate teamwork on the cloud.
2,0,2,If you get tired, we can change sides.
3,1,0,That's how you give a big presentation.
4,0,0,It was because everyone had their own briefcase that they became endangered.
5,0,0,How are you liking the shared workspace?
4,0,0,Death contracts should always be a one man job.
2,2,0,We're filing the long form.
2,2,0,I really appreciated your support in there.
3,1,1,You know what they say about men with long briefcases.
0,2,0,It took me years to move up to middle management.
4,0,0,This is heavy like Kim's nude selfie.
3,1,1,Let go on three. Ready?
2,2,0,FORGET about trying to cut out the middle man!
4,0,1,In the end he had only budgeted enough for three pall bearers.
4,0,0,This better stop with your third-party filing.
4,0,0,This is the longest case we've had in ages....
4,0,0,His presentation fell a little flat.
3,1,0,I'm a very hands-on supervisor.
2,1,1,I wouldn't really say this case is brief, exactly.
4,0,0,They need three of us?
5,0,0,I knew we'd have to go to the Cleveland meeting on a bicycle built for three.
3,1,0,I know it's not full of cash, but she doesn't.
3,1,0,Do you really think they'll like what we brought?
4,1,0,Nuclear codes, no, this is the president's basketball bracket.
3,1,0,I bet they didn't think a white guy could play the koto.
3,1,0,Remember at the corners you and Johnson walk clockwise.
4,0,0,Whoever called this a brief case never had to carry it.
2,2,0,I fear you're on the wrong side in this issue.
3,1,0,And please, this time don't say, " This product lets you cut out the middle-man" during our sale's pitch.
4,0,0,There's a giraffe in there. Don't ask.
4,0,0,No, my part is way heavier than yours.
2,1,1,I'd like to go back to just carpooling.
4,0,0,We've got a huge case in our hands.
3,1,0,I'll do the talking.
4,0,0,Most power trios only have one guitar, but this is ridiculous.
5,0,0,I hate sax season.
4,0,0,Just like I said, she wasn't going to notice it as anything out of the ordinary.
4,0,0,No, you can't be in front. It's a Trump rally.
4,0,0,I'm sure this us not what we meant when we asked for a triple bassoon.
4,0,0,Even the best lawsuits must end.
3,1,0,Sad that Donald was run over by a steam roller...
5,0,0,yes Mark, I know it is a "big" presentation
5,0,0,This lawyer's brief is anything but.
2,1,1,I still say we should not have brought the long form!
3,1,0,Which part of being a team player did you not understand?
4,0,0,When it comes to cartoon captions truncated ones are the best.
5,0,0,The court is expecting briefs. Wait 'til they see our long-johns.
4,0,0,How did your interview go?
4,0,0,It's been a very long case.
2,0,1,"Briefs", my ass!
4,0,0,Will you remind me again what we're telling people is inside of this thing?
4,1,0,It's gonna be a long trial
2,1,1,Are we all on the same page?
4,0,0,This is carrying "in triplicate" a bit too far. Don't you think?
5,0,0,It's from the short-fingered store, but I guarantee you there is no problem.
4,0,0,I heard they’re adding 2 more guys to the Fail Safe Team.
4,0,0,Please turn down the job downstairs!
3,1,0,Blah blah blah
3,1,0,We need to start making these legal briefs a little, uh... briefer.
4,0,0,What are you looking at?
4,0,0,I told you we should have gone with plan B.
1,1,1,No one needs to know the President is travelling to Lanikai Beach again.
4,0,0,Any idea for a caption?
5,0,0,I don't think this is really what a "three way" is.
2,1,1,Why does he always get to be up front?
4,0,0,It's the original manuscript of Long Day's Journey Into Night
4,0,0,Welcome aboard! The company says all of this promotes teamwork, but revolving doors are still a real hot button issue with HR.
3,0,0,You got a better way of getting him into the rally?
4,0,0,Gatekeepers never challenge our intent.
4,0,0,Think we'll be noticed?
4,0,0,I wish we were drawn with bigger hands.
3,1,0,The flute paid the piper. This is his casket.
4,0,0,This time, remember to swing wide on the turns!
2,1,1,People will talk about this merger for decades.
3,1,0,We need to take our case to a higher court.
3,0,1,It's hush-hush, but supposedly he died from an eating disorder.
3,0,1,You're the new guy, aren't you? Word to the wise: Nonconformity doesn't wash here. Other side, pal.
4,0,0,Yes, I know. But my accountant likes the long form.
1,1,1,A briefcase on wheels? That would look weird.
5,0,0,Too bad we have to destroy the Empire State Building with this dirty bomb, because that last scene in 'Sleepless in Seattle still brings tears to my eyes.
4,0,0,Collaborative Execution.
3,1,0,I feel like we all have a handle on this case.
3,1,0,Thank God we all work in the same building.
4,0,0,This is carrying teamwork to far.
2,1,0,Glad its an NRA approved violin case. There's an RPG launcher inside.
3,1,0,You sure attachépooling is a thing?
4,0,0,Why am I carrying it? Well, I'm Italian and I don't play the keyboard
1,0,2,Corporations are people too, but their coffins are more compact.
2,2,0,Yeah, full of layoff notices, but one handle is fake so that none of us can know for sure who delivered them to HR.
2,1,1,Frankly, gentlemen, the prosecution is always tremendously intimidated by the size of my legal pads.
4,0,0,Guys, I know we are three men doing one job, but I think we could at least bring separate briefcases to work.
3,0,1,Next time can we take the Hearse?
2,0,2,Of course I'm worried. People always want to cut out the middleman.
4,0,0,Enough with the middle man jokes already!
2,2,0,Never thought I'd be a Les Paul bearer at this age.
2,1,0,Your success as a lawyer depends on how well you can lengthen a case and create easy work for your partners!
4,0,0,It's a proud office tradition, long board chess at lunchtime.
3,0,0,I'm not looking forward to the bathroom breaks at this meeting.
3,0,0,Gun control.
3,1,0,The next time they send us to a board meeting we need to check on how long the board is.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but our ad specified that we are looking for a highbrow right hand man.
3,1,0,Just be glad you only work on the *third* floor!
3,1,0,The Johnson brief is anything but.
4,0,0,Let go now , before they take your tan .
3,0,1,They'll never be looking for a body in a body-size suitcase carried by three people.
3,1,0,I didn't realize how much we'd be investing in the sharing economy.
4,0,0,I think she's impressed.
4,0,0,This "corporate culture" thing stinks.
4,0,0,And they all said that a three-company merger wouldn't work
2,2,0,OK guys, I totally get carpools, but how is this supposed to help the environment?
2,2,0,Why do you always get the lighter end?
1,2,1,I honestly thought that 'consolidating our workforce' meant getting laid off.
4,0,0,So much for the sharing economy.
3,0,1,I would have expected you to be on the left.
4,0,0,For the NSA briefs we use extralegal paper.
4,0,0,When they ask "Where's Waldo?", let me do the talking!
4,0,0,Harvey, this is the last time I'm going to tell you. This case is for briefs, not long johns!
2,1,1,I used to think we were gong paperless.
3,1,0,I told ("told" underlined or bold) you it was a long shot!
4,0,0,This should show them that the " Father, Son and Holy Spirit" is a real name for our company.
3,1,0,Vail or Breckenridge?
3,0,0,Maybe we're taking this "Sharing Society" a little too far.
3,1,1,It feels wrong calling it a briefcase.
3,1,0,I miss the days when our briefcase was short and succinct.
4,0,0,https://account.newyorker.com/change-password/=c80fe5a5533bae6c71396f56818cd3440
4,0,0,She was totally checking out the 'threefcase'.
5,0,0,C'mon Fred, you know the drill. Carry with the left and shake with the right.
2,2,0,...and for tomorrow's executive training I'll be showing you proper coffee break etiquette.
4,0,0,Why does he always get the first handle...
4,0,1,It's not brief, is it?
4,0,0,I look forward to the day they put the "brief" back into briefcase.
4,0,0,It may be the company briefcase, but I occupy the central position.
3,1,0,Don't forget the cannolis
4,0,0,Corporate downsizing meetings give me the willies.
4,0,0,We're in this together.
4,0,0,We can't let the voters know.
2,2,0,Don't blame me. I'm just the middleman.
2,2,1,Yep, I'm the middle man.
4,0,0,I'd never heard of a three-man Tommy gun.
4,0,0,Feeling a little attache today, Bill?
3,0,0,I was her right-hand man until she became a a one-woman band.
4,0,0,The irony of calling this a 'brief' is getting out of hand.
2,2,0,i'm really tired of holding up your end
4,0,0,First your hair, now you're a rightie?
4,1,0,This is not exactly what I meant when I said we should handle this together.
4,1,0,Do you think we'll get desks near each other?
3,2,0,Here in Ottawa, we call it the "Hockey Stick" not the "Football".
4,0,0,A connected world is a better world. Right?
2,2,0,Of course, size matters
2,0,0,This is absolutely my biggest case so far!
4,0,0,Does she realize this is all of her paperwork?
2,2,0,Sometimes I wonder about this new sharing economy.
4,0,0,Because we're a team. That's why!
4,0,0,why are you being so distant?
3,1,0,Must you always take the opposing side of every case?
4,0,0,I can't believe THIS is what they came up with for the 21st century casket.
4,0,0,The board's really going to like our long-term plan.
4,0,0,Wait until the jury gets a look at these Mormon briefs.
4,0,0,Everyone just play it cool and we can sneak this surf board down to the beach after our 1 o'clock with finance.
2,3,0,You weren't kidding about a heavy caseload.
2,1,1,Just hold your end up and we'll do fine.
4,0,0,Once we get started just take your cue from us.
4,0,0,Yes, you go wide at corners.
5,0,0,Time to file another class action lawsuit.
2,2,0,This isn't the threesome I had in mind.

4,0,0,It''s expected to be a long trial.
3,1,0,We can't let her go without her trombone.
4,0,0,No matter how many samples they take, it still comes back with more Prozac than Cymbalta.
4,1,0,Its our extended version of Monopoly's new board game!
4,0,0,The prosecutor is anything but brief.
2,3,0,Oh but you should see the size of the prosecutor!
3,1,0,The judge keeps extending the case!
3,1,0,Handling a heavy caseload.
4,0,0,Do you really need the middleman?
3,1,0,I just thought that "pulling your weight" was more of a metaphor.
3,0,2,I thought you said you were left handed.
2,2,0,This is one of his lengthier briefs.
4,1,0,I'm sorry that class moved to Friday.
3,1,0,I kept warning him to fix the parking brake on that steamroller of his.
3,0,0,She is police! God Bless America!!

4,1,0,What did you expect? It is a limousine company, after all.
3,0,1,I'm glad the judge granted our extension.

3,1,0,I still say this is a funny way to take our client with us.
3,1,0,I think this teamwork thing has run its course
3,1,0,We're taking our case to a higher court.
2,1,0,When we head upstream, you'll have to do all the steering.
4,0,0,Remember, act like we just met.
4,0,0,This is why I prefer to print just the executive summary.

4,1,0,This is no picnic...
3,0,1,And briefcasepooling saves on what now?

4,0,0,Flat Stanley has been to more countries than Hillary clinton
3,1,0,Get a grip, will you?!
2,0,1,I'm just happy we're not sharing a brain.

3,2,0,Every merger has its inconveniences.
2,2,0,What happens when one of us has to go to the bathroom?
3,1,0,Instead of all the fine print, we've started using longer paper.
2,1,2,OK, OK, I’m gonna get a thumb drive.
3,1,0,It took me three years to get the middle handle.

2,3,0,You're right. He does fit.
5,0,0,Hey, do you think in the future briefcases will have four handles?

4,0,0,This is not inconspicuous.
1,2,0,'Who's turn to take it home tonight?'
3,1,0,As long as we're outside the suitcase, I figure we must be doing something right.
3,1,0,So my wife says, ‘Why don’t you each get your own briefcase?’ Women, right?
4,0,0,Just use "joint" in the presentation.
4,0,0,These three guys need to hold one suitcase because of their ridiculously small hands.
4,0,0,I think the "team player" idea has gone too far!
4,0,0,I WAS HAPPY TO JOIN THE RIDE SHARE PROGRAM, BUT THIS...
4,1,0,When I die, I'm leaving my handle to you.

3,1,0,Not so bad being a pall-bearer for an anorexic.
3,0,0,I wish I could see the look on his face when he can't find the body.
3,1,0,I had no idea this is what middle management looks like.
2,2,0,Be cool. We're only here to case the joint.
3,1,1,He insisted on a contract no longer than one page.
3,0,1,Sharing a desk is OK, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,1,So, how are you related to the thin man?
4,0,0,You lefties always screw things up.
4,1,0,For Chrissake, Ted -- stop whistling the theme song from The Godfather.
2,2,0,Which side of this case are you on?

2,1,1,In retrospect, I don't think I fully understood what "making partner" entailed.
3,1,0,The boss wanted it on illegal size paper.
4,1,0,going our way?
4,1,0,Don't believe anyone who calls them legal briefs.
4,0,0,It is no an indication of physical weakness; we believe in 'shared responsibility'.....
4,0,0,I think we've found the limits of the sharing economy.
3,1,0,Of course it's three-brief case. That's why they call them tri-als

4,0,0,Let's hope the doorman doesn't remember we were booked as a quartet!
2,2,0,Why do they always want small unmarked bills?
4,0,0,Mac feared the case was a dead giveaway that they were fishing for insider secrets.
2,1,0,You might think she never saw men share the same briefcase before.
3,1,0,Look to the bright side: We get to use the security HOV lane!
4,1,0,It's a vintage contra-bassoon, bitch.
4,0,0,We will wait for practice till neighbors have gone to sleep.
5,0,0,Keep it together, man! Remember, we last saw Mr. Benning yesterday afternoon and he seemed fine.
3,1,0,Maybe if you worked a little harder you'd be middle handle material.
4,0,0,I'm not sure Ray is pulling his weight.
3,0,0,She wants me
4,0,0,If we can sell square bowling balls, we can sell anything.

3,0,1,Who're we kidding?
4,0,1,We've been separated! Why do we still use this conjoined triplets briefcase?

4,0,0,Have you seen the new bathrooms yet?
3,1,0,Tell me again, what's our Plan B?

1,2,1,Looks like we all have a good handle on the case.
4,0,0,Do you think she noticed?
3,1,0,Still, let's keep it brief.
4,0,1,If you ask me, this is a conspicuously large payoff.

4,0,0,You sure this is the client that craves sea serpent sushi?
3,1,0,We're all handling the case!
3,1,0,Yes, the carpooling made sense, but we're now carrying it too far....
3,0,1,Yes, it is a big large for a briefcase, but it's where Trump keeps his other set of hands.
4,0,0,It's a solid value.
4,0,0,Yes, the new long form is more difficult to use, but the ability to deduct escort services as physical therapy AND to bill at three times our normal rate make it win-win.

4,0,0,The case is closed
4,0,0,Can you help me unwind?
4,0,0,I blame the carpool culture.
2,2,0,There's talk of merger.
4,1,0,This team thing has go too far !
4,0,0,The boss wants us to try out manager a trois, but I think it feels too much like three on a satchel. I've done that. It didn't end well.
3,1,0,This team work stuff is getting out of hand.
3,1,0,Get used to it. NRA amicus briefs are not friendly and they're not brief.
3,1,0,I'd say we've tripled our productivity.
4,0,0,This may be the biggest presentation of my career....
3,1,0,I represent the Stooges.

1,3,0,I put in two years with the third handle.
4,0,0,New office stationery policy....we write on scrolls.
3,0,0,Just think of how long it took us to get a handle on this.
2,2,0,I don't know about you but I have a really good feeling about that interview Jeff.
3,1,0,Do you even lift?
2,1,2,Should we really be calling this a 'brief'case?
3,0,1,Now remember…when we get on-stage I’ll count to three, we let him out and all yell, 'Happy Birthday, Boss'.
4,0,0,I just carry this handle around in my pocket.
3,0,1,Get off my case, Fred.
3,1,1,What do you mean you want to cut out the middleman?
5,0,0,Why'd she have to unload all her baggage on us?" "I know. I never even met the girl.
3,1,0,Remember, fellas. This is EVERYBODY'S lunch.
2,2,0,Hey stop complaining. I NEVER get the window or the aisle seat.
4,1,0,This is going to be the presentation to end all presentations.
2,1,1,If our seats are three across, we should be able to get some work done on the flight.
3,1,0,I hope one of you brought the extra mouthpieces for our bassoon.
5,0,0,There's no 'I' in 'team'.
4,1,0,Uh Greg... our offices are on different floors
3,0,0,I'm used to smaller caseloads.
2,1,0,Don't you hate these treble damage cases?
4,0,0,This client is unique.
3,1,1,I'm glad we all work on the same floor.
4,0,0,We went paperless.
4,1,0,If you think the company's new team briefcase is bad, wait till you see the redesigned executive washroom.
4,0,0,We'll need to show unity.
3,0,1,This isn’t what I had in mind when I signed up for job sharing.
4,0,0,It's a man's job.
3,1,0,2 can be as bad as 1, it's the loneliest number since...Capitalism, right guys?
1,3,0,What does management not understand about 'brief'?
3,1,0,Yeah well being in the middle there's not much glamour either.
4,0,0,Republicans scoffed at the Full Employment Act.
2,2,0,Glad to see we're all on the same page.
3,1,0,If we make Shapiro partner does that mean we're going to have to get a bigger briefcase?
3,0,0,it's a very long suitcase for my very long dildos
4,0,0,I get the whole three-in-a-box leadership model, but this is too much.
4,0,0,Feels like a corporate version of a chain gang.
4,1,0,It's the new IRS long form.
4,0,0,It's light if we carry it all together,right?
4,0,0,Did you see her face when I said 'let's get horizontal?'
4,0,0,You're just third handle, so try to keep a lid on it when we get in there.
3,0,0,This won't fit under the seat.
4,1,0,We need a roadie!
4,0,0,I guess 3 does not = company, after all.
4,0,0,Francis: things are looking up, this case is ours...
4,0,0,Just ignore the sensitive documents in case the papers shifted around.
4,0,0,OK, next time you can have Shotgun.

4,0,0,You're drawing needless attention to yourself.
3,1,0,I didn't realize that airport security would be such an issue, either.
4,0,1,I will not tolerate another threesome joke... lady
2,2,0,Remember, we shake hands at the same time too.
4,0,0,I think they've taken the whole "team building" thing too far this time.
4,0,1,Guess I should mention that I forgot the combination lock to my portion of our briefcase.
5,0,0,By the way, Moe, I paid extra for your handle.
2,2,0,Next we change the light bulb.
4,0,0,Sure it's cost effective, but brief case sharing is extreme.
4,1,0,Don't you think about time for Flat Stanley to walk on his own two feet?
2,1,1,He fudges the numbers, I display confusing graphics, you close the deal.
4,0,0,Stop it! No will notice three dudes in suits with a three handle suitcase!
2,2,0,What did you think "three for the price of one" meant?
3,1,0,It was easier when they really were briefcases.
4,0,0,Quit your gripin'--plenty of musicians would jump at the chance to be second trombone and third handle.
4,0,0,No matter what case we're working on, you always have to take the other side, don't you.
4,0,0,Did you remember to bring the ammo?
5,0,0,Do you think she suspects?" "Nah. And besides, no one really wanted Trump to become president anyway.
3,0,1,Maybe best to leave it at car sharing.
3,1,0,Next they are going to merge us into one big one.
2,1,1,At least we can take the HOV elevator now.
3,1,0,You are always too far left for us.
4,0,0,Apparently, you found the key to the the portable tanning booth!
3,0,0,You know what they say about small hands... a big package.
3,1,0,Remember we call it an Uber briefcase and think it's perfect for a shared economy.
4,0,0,This new "power team" approach is getting out of hand.
3,1,0,This team building is getting out of hand.
3,1,0,In this case, it's not so brief.
4,1,0,Will I ever get a chance to be first handle?
4,0,0,"That's quite enough of '??Three bags full'.
4,0,0,How come I alway get the heavy part?
3,0,0,I told you, elevator pitches are hard.
4,0,0,What happens in the office stays in the office.
3,1,0,I really thought I was going to get the lead on this case.
4,0,0,Did anyone tell Ms. Myers that kids stay free?
0,1,3,They only allow one carry-on.
4,0,0,Flat Stanley deserves better
4,0,0,“When will I get my turn as front man of the sales force?
4,1,0,I'm a big idea man.
4,1,0,I'm tired of being the middle-man.I yearn to be more.
3,0,0,If you ask me, that team-building management consultant has gone too far this time!
4,0,1,When did I sign up to be a pallbearer for the corporate world!
4,0,0,Most people don't realize it's congenital.
2,1,1,Ironically, I stopped carpooling.
4,0,0,I hope they like snakes.
4,0,0,I don't know what's inside, anymore than you do....
4,0,0,That's an extremely slow elevator.
4,0,0,How else would we deliver a giant check?
5,0,0,I'm loving this new Long Vuitton briefcase.
3,1,0,Sorry, Brian—you’re off the Henderson case.
1,2,1,The boss will be impressed with our new meaning of "teamwork".
5,0,0,We need to make a pit stop.
4,0,0,You take the kill shot, we'll handle the collateral damage.
3,1,0,Ready for another long meeting?
3,0,0,We have the same briefcase.
3,0,0,Welcome to the sales team.
3,1,0,You never see my side of it, do you?
4,0,0,Why don't they make coffins like this?
4,0,0,On the plus side, more rules, more decrees.
3,1,0,After we prop him up in his office chair, I'm out.
4,0,0,Call Dr Ben Carson, quick!
3,0,0,I usually open carry but I can't find my keys.
3,1,0,Thank goodness for concealed carry.
4,0,0,This performance is for the Trilateral Commission.

4,0,0,One day, perhaps in a year or two, you may walk on this side.
4,0,0,Trump-Mat
3,1,0,It's "our" report, but Slide 27 is all me.
4,0,0,You left-leaning Liberals give me a pain.
2,2,0,Fortunately, the prosecution didn't have much of a case.
3,1,1,Just sharing the workload
3,1,0,How do we get this into the cloud?
4,0,0,Don't you dare leave us holding the bag!
2,2,0,Let's hope we enjoy Take Your Firearms to Work Day.
4,1,0,You're such a maverick.
1,1,2,Bet it was hard for her not to ask us what this is.
2,2,0,I can't keep getting in-between you guys.
3,1,0,Yes, there is no I in team but there is in briefcase and I want my own.
4,1,0,See that, she didn't even ask....
3,0,0,My wife picked it out!
4,0,0,Luigi, why do you always have to be right!!
4,0,0,No political statement necessary
4,0,0,Can't you just feel the synergy?
2,0,2,Judge wants to move this case along.
4,0,0,"Ben, I just want to say two words about the future....Are you listening to me?" "Telescopic Pointers!" (Pissy little take on The Graduate)
4,0,0,Why, oh, why do they call them briefs?
3,1,1,You'll never move up a handle with an attitude like that.
4,1,0,I'm booked full this afternoon. Hope it's a short eulogy.
3,0,1,I don't recall "heavy-lifting" being included in the job description.
1,3,0,Congrats, guys. We are now too big to fail.
2,2,0,Remember. We can't look like pool hustlers.
4,0,0,Back before the revolution we had roadies, we could choose our costumes and hair-dos, and heavy metal didn't mean a steel guitar case.
4,0,0,A brief is supposed to be as the name implies, Brad.
4,0,0,I'm heading to the restroom. You too?
4,0,0,Flat screen TV, guaranteed cure for the Monday Blues.
4,0,0,So is this what they mean about a "team effort"?
4,0,0,"I see you have chosen to oppose us on this case".
4,0,0,What's today's strategy, Three Musketeers or Three Stooges?
5,0,0,When they ask if we want to extend our presentation, we will be prepared.
4,0,0,I know, I know, but it still feels like a corporate walking rope.
5,0,0,I got the Trump Special: extra-long roll, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomato and extra mayo. What do you got?
4,0,0,Stop calling "Shotgun!" before we get to the car!
3,0,2,This presentation is dead, and we're the pallbearers.
4,0,0,Who's papers are who's
3,1,0,I think your lunch just moved into my jurisdiction.
3,1,0,Aren't there limits to this teamwork concept?
5,0,0,If P. C. Vey had given us normal sized hands.....it would not take three of us to carry this suitcase.
2,1,0,I think they will ask us to drop the case.
4,0,0,I used to have you job but now I'm the middleman.
4,0,0,This is one heavy race card.
4,0,0,''I hope they're as impressed with our presentation as they're sure to be blown-away by our exclusive 3-grip presentation case...''
4,0,0,You realize this makes you an accomplice, right?
2,0,2,This is the biggest deal I ever worked on
5,0,0,I know there is economy of scale, but this this is a nuisance on the bus.
3,1,0,I thought by now I'd be carrying the case alone.
4,0,0,One guitar, three guitarists? That may be taking novelty too far.
3,2,0,Are we going to have to wear matching suits every day?
3,1,0,I see the two of you have finally gotten a handle on what we do around here!
5,0,0,The consultants said it would promote teamwork!
4,0,0,This is why we call it "a Board Meeting."
4,0,0,Get over here, people are starting to stare; this is London and they carry on the other side.
3,1,0,He wanted a corporate burial service.
2,2,0,Don't you think they're carrying this "TEAM Work" thing a tad too far?
3,0,1,When we get to the spiral staircase, I call back.
4,1,0,Synergy sucks.
4,1,0,I think we're right to take the long view of company prospects.
3,0,1,The shredding is today; but we'll scatter the ashes on New Year's Eve.
3,1,0,She was totally checking me out.
5,0,0,No, I do not want to get the nine foot sub sandwich again.
2,2,0,I was asked to be a pallbearer for last quarter’s strategy, too.
3,2,0,It's the giant hot dog from that other caption contest.
4,0,0,If you ask me, these commuter challenges are getting out of hand.
2,0,1,You've obviously never been an 'Express Rest' pall bearer before.
2,3,0,The sharing economy has officially gone too far.
4,0,0,Her presentation was too flat
2,1,1,Not much....my lunch, some paperwork, a shovel... why do you ask ?
4,0,0,Nuclear codes??? No, these are Hillary's classified emails she sent from her Vic 20 and her Commodore 64.
3,1,0,but we have separate rooms
1,4,0,Should we share a cab?
4,0,0,Having their long briefcase idea rejected again, the three salesman had no idea what to do next, until fate intertwined in an unusual and silly sequence of events with the elevator that led them into Hollywood slapstick.
3,1,0,Socialism sure makes work lighter.
4,0,0,Looks like our ex-wife is on our again.
5,0,0,Three Surfboards in one carry-on. Good idea Mingo.
5,0,0,Next we discuss collateral damage.
2,2,0,I suppose it's too late to change my mind.
3,1,0,We need to look like we’re a team.
3,1,0,Everyone is going to think this ramrod is a briefcase.
4,0,0,Case closed.
2,2,0,So how does this work with carry-on?
4,0,0,They salesman said there is no such thing as a 'briefer' case.
3,1,0,Personally, I think the case is too big for this firm.
4,0,0,It's heavier than it looks...
5,0,0,How often does the NRA think we'll need a grenade launcher?
4,0,0,Hey Bob... Why don't they have pupils?
1,3,0,That's just the way it is, least seniority gets the back handle.
2,2,0,The accountant said to file the 1040 long form since we are organized as a partnership.
4,0,0,why the long file?
3,0,0,Ahem...we're a left-wing organization!
4,1,0,He always wanted his ashes scattered near the boardroom.
2,3,0,Did you bring the key?
4,0,0,This A4 paper is bull@%#*!
3,2,0,We felt a violin case was too Godfather.
3,0,0,Well, I guess I did write 'works well on teams.'
3,1,0,I really hope this is the last of the long forms.
3,1,0,If anyone asks, we're here for the croquet tournament, okay?
4,0,0,One of these days, someone is bound to figure out we are playing croquet on the roof during lunch break.
4,0,0,Corporate downsizing has really made us closer.
5,0,0,All your presentations fall flat, Higgins.
4,0,0,Do you know whats in this case? Your looking very shady today.
2,2,0,Stay close.
4,1,0,No, I'm Larry, and you're Moe.
2,2,1,I hope this doesn't mean I get the middle seat.
4,0,0,Quick! To the tandem Gocycle!
3,0,1,I think we've got a handle on this case.
3,1,0,Steve always said this job would kill him.
3,2,0,I'm having difficulty getting used to the extent of our merger.
4,0,0,It's the new corporate plan for standardizing sleeve buttons.
3,1,0,No, this doesn't mean we'll be sharing briefs later.
4,0,0,We probably don't need our documents in triplicate.
4,1,0,Baggage a trois again tonight?
5,0,0,The conjoined bovine triplets were as inseparable in death as they were in life.
3,0,1,Not the brief case we had hoped for.
4,0,0,Why do people stare when you take the handle at the back?
4,0,0,I know his hands are small, but I have never seen a president asking for such a big gun.
5,0,0,Our case is bigger because we carry boxers instead of briefs.
5,0,0,He's not heavy, he's my broker.
2,2,0,I had to use the long form.
4,0,0,This is even better than car pooling.
4,0,0,Which one of us is the shooter?
4,0,0,Maybe we're taking this carpooling thing a little too far.
4,0,0,How was I supposed to know they didn't like electric guitars?
4,0,0,These slim fit caskets are the best.
4,0,0,It's good training for later.
1,3,0,Play your cards right, you'll be standing on this side in two, three weeks.
4,0,0,I can't believe they thought our script was too long.
4,0,0,Bernie honestly isn't as bad for Wall Street as I was expecting.
4,0,0,This is a big presentation
5,0,0,Don't hate to be bearer of bad news?
2,2,0,We let go on three
3,0,0,We were in a band together. How did you know him?
5,0,0,I think we should get smart phones.
3,1,0,And what did you think job sharing meant?
3,1,1,We can handle this case together.
4,0,0,The new 'bring your own table' to the conference room concept is catching on!
3,0,0,Play your cards right kid and this handle could be yours in a few years.
3,1,0,I'm feeling it's little more heavy than awkward.
4,0,0,I thought you said this was a BRIEF case.
4,0,0,Which way to the Mortuary?
4,0,0,You should have seen the size of the Beta version.
4,0,0,I told you the prosecution had a strange case.
4,0,0,Henry had answered the odd job ad. Henry got the job. Henry's first day as Suitcase Carrier Helper.
3,2,0,Just to be clear, the 'long form' was not my idea.
2,1,0,It really is a three-man job.
2,2,0,You're outta line, Mister.
4,0,0,Apparently it's a bad idea to bring a list of Americans killed by guns to a Ted Cruz rally
4,0,0,It's sleek. It's NOW. And pallbearing will never be the same. It's who I AM.
1,0,3,I started off where you are. And look at me now!
2,2,0,Think of it as a stretch briefcase.
4,0,0,You know Ted, three on a briefcase is bad luck.
2,3,0,This is our first big case, boys. Let's not mess it up.
3,2,0,Have a good night's sleep last night? I happened to notice you tossing and turning a little.
2,1,1,Not sure briefcase-pooling is going to catch on.
2,2,0,Taking this merger business a bit to far, don't you think?
3,1,0,We really killed that presentation!
2,3,0,I understand you've thought of a way to reduce our carrying cost.
4,0,0,Maybe 'Three Suits and a Guitar' isn't catchy enough.
4,0,0,This "team" concept sucks.
3,1,0,I'm the one doing the heavy lifting
4,0,0,This is the last group project for me.
4,1,0,Don't touch my bag, please.
4,0,0,Let's wait until after the service to see what happened to the other pallbearers.
1,2,0,Act nonchalant.
4,0,0,Siamese businessmen, joined by the esprit de corpse.
4,0,0,I think the merger is going well.
2,2,0,Elevators good. Revolving doors bad.
4,0,0,That presentation killed!
4,0,0,Maybe we should've told her that we just share a briefcase...
5,0,0,Because Mr. Trump has very, very, huuge, big plans
3,1,0,When we asked if you were a lefty, we weren't referring to your politics.
3,1,0,We're playing the St. Valentine's Massacre tonight.
4,1,0,I used to be a fan of job-sharing.
4,0,0,I think we carried it off well
4,0,1,Just saying...they carried this team-building thing too far.
4,0,0,REMEMBER,WE ARE ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT.
4,0,0,This doesn't work correctly when you're on the opposite side, Brian!
4,0,0,I know everyone loves party subs, but is silly.
3,1,0,You do know, Agent Mulder, that this lamp is intended exclusively for interrogations?
2,1,0,How do we get through the revolving door again?
4,1,0,Did you see the strange look that woman in the elevator gave us?
4,0,0,She stared because you're on the wrong side.
5,0,0,We need to present a unified front.
5,0,0,I had no idea I would be pallbearer to so many cases until after Justice Scalia passed.
4,0,0,This time, let me do the reveal. You and Frank try and act surprised.
2,1,1,We need a smaller briefcase.
4,0,0,This collaborative workspace, team building crap has finally gone too far.
4,0,0,It's a new type of briefcase that guaranties we work together!
2,2,1,I'm middle management.
3,0,1,Three's Company
4,0,0,It's a good thing Fenton has a left arm.
5,0,0,Working in long-form journalism has its disadvantages.
3,0,2,What did she mean that was a weird massage?
4,0,0,D.T. put me in the middle for a reason, Endie.
5,0,0,Remember, bring out the Bazooka right after I say ' Are you ready to pay for the wall yet Mexico?'
5,0,0,No. Calendaring the team transport agenda is the hardest part of the Bassoon.
4,0,0,"Just going for it" won't get us through the revolving doors.
3,1,0,If this case gets any longer, we'll need to add another attorney.
3,1,0,Being run over has its advantages.
2,2,0,HR is trying out a few new ideas around the shared work space concept.
4,0,0,We're all going to be left holding the bag
4,0,0,Do you realize this is the first time that the captain put us all on the same case?
4,0,1,It's how Frank always wanted to go.
4,0,0,Thanks for helping us this far, we can get it from here. It's just some of those little yellow statuette things, nothing special. Have fun watching the show.
4,0,0,I'll brief you later on the case
3,0,1,Remember its your turn this time to request it as a carry-on.
4,0,0,Do you always have to be on the opposing side of everything?
5,0,0,Last week it was pall bearer, next week 10 foot subs for a retirement party.
4,0,0,Sharing a salary is where I draw the line.
4,0,0,Can you believe management is hiring consultants to help get rid of "redundancies"? What a waste of money.
3,1,0,He's holding up his end, but he isn't pulling his weight.
3,1,0,The evidence in this case is overwhelming.
2,2,0,I guess we should have expected this in today's sharing economy.
4,1,0,Now do you grasp what the PM meant by 'three ministers with portfolio'?
3,1,0,Remember Jim, we need you, try not to fly off the handle again!
2,0,2,I never dreamed I'd be honored with the privilege of helping transport Mr. Trump's ego.
4,1,0,This really is a big Have you ever been put on a case this big before?
3,1,0,Even split three ways, this is a very big case.
4,0,0,Sometimes teamwork takes up space.
4,0,0,Just be glad he was so thin
2,2,0,Nobody here handles the big cases by themselves.
3,0,1,For me, the jury is still out on the new three per cubicle policy.
5,0,0,Such a long time since we had a brokered presentation.
3,1,0,Wish I could put her in the box too.
4,0,1,Don't turn around. She is still staring at us.
2,1,1,Why do we need a xylophone for the business meeting again?
4,0,0,...and when you feel ready to also be a little more flexible in your attitude, you're welcome to come back and join our group again.
3,1,0,It's all about teamwork, but the leg chain can drive you nuts.
2,2,0,When they said I'd be in 'mergers and acquisitions' I had no idea.
2,2,0,This may prove cumbersome near the urinal.
4,0,0,I worry the witness's deposition might be too long?
4,0,0,New deal at the office, "Buy one get two free!"
1,1,1,Must you always speak in the third person?
2,2,0,Next time, maybe don't be so quick to volunteer for the big case.
2,1,1,I don’t care if you have a blister. Get over here. We look stupid.
4,0,0,You are on the wrong side.
4,0,0,How else should we carry our long underwear?
3,1,0,If anyone asks, this is a contrabassoon.
3,1,0,Mine's the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
3,1,0,These mergers are becoming a little excessive.
4,0,0,Your desk or mine?
3,1,0,Our last partner never held up his end.
3,0,0,It's for our crowd sourcing presentation.
1,3,0,Who suggested we have a giant hoagie for lunch?
4,0,0,Don't feel funny-a lot of us share the same briefcase.
3,1,0,This all-in-one technology is getting a bit out of hand
4,0,0,It's capricious and arbitrary.
3,1,0,They won't suspect us, we're not Muslims!
5,0,0,Our workload has literally gotten heavier.
4,0,0,It's a union requirement…
4,0,0,Had you known the corporate debt long?
3,1,0,The board of directors demanded we stop bringing them the short report.
3,1,0,This isn't about taking sides.
5,0,0,This is not the 'brief threesome' that I thought it was.
3,1,0,Let's just slide the bill under the door.
3,0,1,If you fit, we'll sneak you out next.
4,0,0,Now we all get paid for overtime.
3,1,0,It was one thing when they put all three of is one cubicle and now this!
2,2,0,I think it's time that we learn PowerPoint.
4,0,0,We think you're taking "attaché" too literally.
3,0,1,Try not to look suspicious
5,0,0,Who does your nails?
3,1,0,If your playing Wagner, the contrabassoon player typically needs an extra set of lungs.
3,0,0,This is what comes from exaggerating.
3,1,0,You know that teaming software they got us? This is the computer.
3,0,0,Find whoever filed the Kerouac suit, then fire the bastard.
4,0,0,Speak softly, but carry a big brief case.
4,0,0,Still better than at the hip....
3,1,0,Downsize THIS.
3,1,0,Is this the three legged race for hands?
4,0,0,If he says no, you cover the door while Larry and I break out the long form
4,0,0,If everybody takes their cues from me, we should be able to run the table.
2,2,0,Well, I guess the project really IS dead.
4,0,0,There is nothing brief about this brief case.
3,1,0,I got shotgun after the presentation.
3,1,0,I'm just the middle man.
2,2,0,And job sharing hits a new low.
4,0,0,Get with the program Schmidt, this is left arm briefcase.
4,1,0,Don't listen to her, we're a trio not a threesome. I promise.
4,0,0,We should have drawn the line at ride sharing.
2,2,0,I think we've got a handle on this.
4,0,0,This is a very lengthy brief.
4,0,0,What's that saying again? Three connected briefcases are better than one.
4,0,0,I had hoped that 'Three Man Briefcase Group' would take me to off-Broadway, not office birthday parties.
3,1,0,Well, I guess this is better than trust falls and ropes courses for team building.
4,0,0,i dont think theyll know its a body
3,1,0,When you suggested a three-way at the office, I had envisioned something a little different.
4,0,0,We are sitting ducks with three rifles in one case. Budget cuts!
3,1,0,I hate these long, drawn-out arguments.
3,0,1,I know we're in a sharing economy, but this is ridiculous.
4,0,0,What do you think Donald meant when he said "So long, losers!" at the end of our presentation?
5,0,0,You needn't mention the steamroller.
1,2,0,Fine next time you can have shotgun
4,0,0,Thanks, guys. It's for my hot dog.
4,0,0,I hear Susan in the elevator is joining our team. We're going to need a bigger case!
4,0,0,I love bonding exercises, but you said how far?
5,0,0,Do you think this guy actually needs this for an overnight subway trip?
4,0,0,And I thought the merger was a bit of a stretch.
4,0,0,I knew our presentation was too long.
2,2,0,Worst three-way ever.
4,0,0,Hansen would have wanted his memorial held on company property. And that steamroller definitely saved us on pallbearers.
3,1,0,This is the longest brief I've ever filed.
4,0,0,Why is she looking at us in such a strange way?
4,0,0,She wouldn't stop staring! You think it was my new cuff links?
3,0,0,We can take it from here. Your role was purely utilitarian.
3,1,0,This is the last time we use a bazooka for an indoor hit.
3,1,0,I hope your briefs aren't touching mine....
3,1,1,Must feel strange being the right-handed minority.
4,0,0,There's got to be a better way to do 'no-iron' pants.
2,1,2,Act normal.
4,0,0,You asked me to buy you that lottery ticket, but what about him?
4,0,0,I hate corporate's new paper size policy
1,3,0,How many lawyers does it take to file a brief?
3,1,0,Frankly, we feel that you're not pulling your own weight.
1,2,1,You're definitely on the wrong side of this case.
4,1,0,"When Paul retires, you can have my spot".
4,0,0,When I become President of this company, we'll have a display table that rolls on wheels.
4,0,0,Groupon?
3,0,1,The rivalry began when pen manufacturers watched the Republican Presidential debates.
3,1,0,It's my week to get the window seat at the desk.
4,0,0,It means we're top brass.
4,1,0,Did the judge say 'brief'?
3,2,0,Switch arms and pivot on three.
4,0,0,My idea is better than yours.
3,0,1,Act like it's heavy when we see Susan
5,0,0,Who are we to deny Bill's final request?
4,0,0,The jury will be delighted when we rest our case.
4,0,0,This is the biggest case we've taken to court
4,0,0,We need to show them we're on the same page.
2,1,1,They're taking this merger much too seriously if you ask me.
4,0,0,This is my first snake charmers convention.
2,2,0,They said this would be brief.
3,0,1,Larry did you forget to poke holes?
3,1,0,If these smart phones get any bigger, I swear I'm giving 'em up.
3,0,1,They're going to know we have cocaine in here unless you guys unpop your eyes.
4,0,0,It's a menage-a-brief.
3,0,0,Cleopatra should help us with this briefcase like she did when we fought Pompey.
3,1,0,When we get in there, you guys drop your ends and I'll pretend it's really heavy.
3,1,0,Thanks for the help, fellas. My wife is going to love these really long earrings.
3,0,1,Don't drop it. This is the biggest case the Firm has had in years.
4,0,0,Your office or mine?
4,1,0,How long did you know Gumby?
5,0,0,He lived and died at the office, makes sense to bury him here, too.
3,1,0,I think they're taking this teamwork thing too far.
4,0,0,I don't trust you guys, either.
4,1,0,I predict a huge increase in productivity after we unveil this rocket launcher.
4,0,0,What did Ben Franklin say about three keeping a secret?
3,0,1,Someone needs to tell the old man what file sharing really means
4,0,0,Well, he did ask for a rock guitar.
0,3,1,Wait. If you're here... who's in the briefcase?
3,1,0,I guess I'm not quite sold on this Briefcase-B-N-B idea.
3,1,0,My last case was even longer.
2,2,0,When Jerry said look like a team, I didn't think this is what he had in mind.
4,0,0,Yes, you're right, the handcuffs would have been totally overdressed.
4,0,0,New addition to sharing economy: Bag Share!
4,0,0,Are you sure the invitation said to bring your own table?
4,0,0,Just say the happy light box gave you the tan.
4,0,0,So, this is the new "football"?
4,1,0,Remember when all you needed to carry was a violin case?
4,0,0,These encryption codes are becoming a problem.
4,0,0,I hope this judge has no problem with long briefs.
4,0,0,Due to the size of the dearly departed the funeral home only needed three pall bearers.
3,1,0,Share an office? Why?
4,0,0,Wait a minute! Weren't we supposed to leave him at the cemetery before coming back for the after-party?
3,1,0,I suppose this has as good a chance as any of distracting from the leg shackles.
4,0,0,I hate meetings where they tell us to bring our own stretcher.
4,1,0,Don't tell anyone it's a folding table.
4,0,0,It shows that we're all on the same page, literally.
3,0,0,Sure it works. The trick is to convince them it's pocket-sized.
4,0,0,You can turn left, but Gus and I are right-wing Republicans.
3,0,1,Keep your hands off my business.
4,0,0,Again, when I told Mr. Simpkins we would take the case, I had no idea.
4,1,0,I think we should go digital.
4,0,0,Post-merger integration they said
4,1,0,So, tomorrow am I driving?
4,0,0,The folks up at sales will just have to acknowledge the Return of Low Tech.
4,0,0,The prosecution keeps saying we're all connected by this case.
5,0,0,Forget it; you're no Rosa Parks!
3,0,0,Of course it is huge. Ya think Donald would want a brief case?
1,2,1,Not every case can be brief
3,0,0,Now if we can just get out of the lobby we're snowboarding by lunchtime.
4,0,0,It'll be hard to tweet about this.
5,0,0,'Don't worry. At the end of this meeting, there will only be two of us.'
3,1,0,Just act natural. Pretend it's a xylophone.
4,0,0,No, I think it's just a case of left-handed-ism.
3,0,1,Team work makes the dream work.
3,1,0,Why do you think they know we're The Three Musketeers?
4,0,0,Look again: The nose of the large head is the chin of the small head.
4,1,0,Isn't it your turn to be the middleman?
2,1,0,We need to have a debriefing.
2,2,0,Remember, our strategy is to keep the presentation short.
3,1,0,The banging, I can explain...but, do you hear someone screaming?
3,1,0,His iMac is the headstone.
4,0,0,They don't pay me enough to transport mummified bodies.
4,0,0,I should warn you that this ensemble never walks in common time.
3,0,0,I do not work on this floor anymore.
5,0,0,I told you the suits were a bad idea
4,0,0,We'll never win the synchronized briefcase carrying contest this way .
3,1,0,Harvey, people who get ahead around here, find their way to the right side of the briefcase.
2,1,0,If you think this is bad, wait til you the bathroom break policy.
3,1,0,The team-building activities lately are not working.
4,0,0,Hilary asked for her longform birth certificate - you know, just in case.
4,0,0,I told you guys it would fit in the elevator.
4,0,0,What do you mean you forgot your combination number?!
4,0,0,You see value in middlemen, right?
3,1,0,If I go down, you guys are coming with me.
4,0,0,Finally, we've all gotten a handle on this case!
4,0,0,Did anyone notice he's missing?
1,3,0,Okay, this is good. We all have a handle on it now.
5,0,0,Sure bigger matters. But not in yoga mats.
4,0,0,The prosecution isn't expecting a long, drawn out case.
4,0,0,This is a heavy guitar! Well you said you needed a lead guitar.
4,0,0,Remember, act like we're not ready to buy!
5,0,0,Our new job description is "white collar Sherpa".
3,1,0,Are you sure this is what the consultant meant by team synergy?
3,0,0,I'm not sure renting a three man brief case is the best way to save money.
4,0,0,Do you think they'll know we're together?
3,0,1,They said to bring a body of evidence.
3,1,0,It's the "not so brief" case.
2,1,1,Job sharing sounded more glamorous in the interview.
4,0,0,Don’t complain, Stan — these new maximus amicus briefs fetch us $200 more per hour to print and file.
4,0,0,Let me know if you find the snow blower.
3,1,0,Pastor always uses his massage table to lay on hands.
4,0,0,You do realize that this is probably the longest legal brief of all times "You must realize that we may be carrying the longest legal brief of all times!
4,0,0,How about we take up ping pong instead?
4,1,0,I think this is your handle.
3,0,1,Boxers or briefs...and you just had to say boxers!
2,3,0,One day you too could be middle briefcase.
3,0,1,It's sort of an eco thing, uses the whole alligator
2,2,0,Remember, they're paying us for big ideas.
3,0,0,They didn't have to kill our proposal
4,0,0,I hate this corporate mergers ... where's our rugged individualism?
5,0,0,Can I use the pen this time?
3,1,0,They can't downsize us, we know where the bodies are buried.
3,1,0,Inefficient? It used to take 6 men to move Pallbearer Bonds.
4,0,0,It's a very big case.
4,0,0,It certainly is about time that they let us bring concealed stinger missile launchers to staff meetings.
4,0,0,This new teamwork initiative has gone to far.
4,1,0,The big brief case would've been completely ridiculous.
4,0,0,Ralph, why can't you side with us on this case?
4,0,0,Says he steamrolled the competition!
4,0,0,Who says a briefcase has to be brief?
3,1,1,I thought legal pads were already too long.
5,0,0,It's "the briefcase." With the nuclear launch key? Big missile, big key.
4,0,0,"Remember we're The Three Musketeers of accounting".
4,0,0,Maybe he is the CEO, but why can't we just cut his sandwiches in half?
4,0,0,This new contract will be great for the company, despite the boss's new found love of Jack Kerouac.
5,0,0,...what's more, you don't have to gate check a PowerPoint presentation.
3,1,0,I hope nobody notices Simmons taking a "Nap" at work.
3,2,0,Someday you'll be Handle One.
4,1,0,If you think this is bad, wait until you see the new toilet seats.
4,0,0,Keeping the GOP candidate secret until the last moment (or poll).
3,1,0,Personally, I think doing everything in triplicate is a waste.
5,0,0,This is taking teamwork a little too far.
2,2,1,I can tell you’re not really lifting.
2,1,1,I told you - keep in brief and to the point - but noooo.
2,2,0,Seriously Bob, don't worry. The first gig was a fluke, everyone loves triple neck guitar groups.
4,0,0,And his like was brief.
3,0,1,I hate being a pallbearer for dead deals.
3,1,0,The truth is, 1/3 the pay is still a lot...
2,3,0,The briefcase is obsolete... that's our sales pitch.
3,2,0,I haven't really been lifting.
4,0,0,Why is everyone getting on my case?
3,1,0,Oh, so you're a conservative?
4,0,0,I replaced my BRIEF-case with this long-winded version.
1,3,0,This draft might get through the House, but the Senate will find it too long.
3,1,0,I don't care if he fires me, next time he can clean his own damn giraffe.
1,2,0,When the boss said he had a big case for us, I thought he was talking legal.
2,2,0,I thought we'd never lay this case to rest.
3,1,0,It's either a very large carrot or an average size stick.
2,2,0,I'm ready for the training wheels to come off.
5,0,0,This way we can honestly say we have three lawyers handling the same case, thus more money for the firm.
4,0,0,No, this doesn't mean I will be bringing my work, and you, home with me.
4,0,0,Think he knows how to steer this thing?
2,2,0,It's his 3 piece suit.
4,0,0,Jerry, if you're going to complain, you shouldn't have opted for the '33 cents on the dollar' downsizing package.
2,0,1,So, you're on the other side of the case now.
4,0,0,This bonding program has gone too far;
4,1,0,It's an extra large table so we can massage Mr. Trump's ego.
4,0,0,I told you guys it was a big case
2,2,0,What did she mean by, "eliminate the middle man?"
3,1,0,This isn't what I thought the boss meant when he said this was a three-man case
4,0,0,You farted in the elevator, didn't you?
3,1,0,I wonder how she guessed that we all work together?
3,1,0,Poor Higgins. Packaging was his world.
3,1,0,We have the edge. The contrabassoon will totally throw them off.
3,1,0,The boss said to get to the office ASAP as soon I as I told him we were presenting a lengthy brief.
4,0,0,I guarantee there's no problem.
4,0,0,It's either this or we're joined at the hip, and frankly, cowhide is more cost-effective.
3,1,0,I always wondered what was meant by the "sharing economy".
4,1,0,As an accountant I shouldn’t say this, but the 1040 long form is getting to be ridiculous.
3,1,0,I hope three on an attache isn't bad luck.
3,2,0,I never thought being a pallbearer would help me work my way up to middle management.
3,0,1,This "Three's Company" reboot has really jumped the shark.
4,0,0,She can't handle the truth!
1,1,1,I told you we can handle this case.
4,0,0,Whose idea was it to take the Big Data project to the conference?
3,1,0,If he says no, I open the case, Barry aims it, and you fire. Okay?

5,0,0,I heard there is a dead rabbit in the box. What do you think?
4,0,0,We really got a handle on this case don't you think.
3,1,0,It evolved after carpooling.
4,0,0,You didn't ask what they meant by "teamwork is our central value"?
2,2,0,People want to know, but they never ask.
4,0,1,Actually, we never ask what's in it.
4,0,0,An awkward team-building exercise seemed like a fitting tribute.
3,1,0,Next time George, you play the piccolo.
3,1,0,Perhaps we're taking this UberPool thing too far
3,1,0,Carpooling I get, but...?
3,1,0,We may all be sharing the workload, but you guys are really doing the heavy lifting.
4,0,0,It's the Donald Trump model.
4,0,0,Well boys, if these company plans somehow come up lost, at least I'll have someone to point the finger at. Hee, hee, hee.
1,3,0,Makes them feel better about our $2,000 per hour consulting fee.
4,0,0,who's this guy in front of us?
4,1,0,Whose idea was it to take car-pooling to the next level?
2,2,0,Talk about luck...three xylophone players in one office.
4,0,0,That was great, we had her boxed in perfectly. Next time it's your turn to fart.
2,2,0,Smith, you are going to have to start pulling your own weight.
3,1,0,Okay, you can have the middle position on the way out.
3,1,0,I told you the one volume encyclopedia was a dumb idea.
3,1,0,Don't you think this teamwork thing is getting out of hand?
5,0,0,I didn't realize I needed this much "hand-holding"!
4,0,0,This being triplets thing is getting old!
4,0,0,It's just like a merger.
5,0,0,Your breath mints are rolling.
2,1,0,On the other hand, our billable hours have tripled.
3,2,0,Think they were impressed by the length of our presentation?
4,0,0,First time using Uber?
5,0,0,Who said three hands are not better than one!
3,1,0,I wonder if she thinks we're compensating.
3,0,1,Someone should have told me about the Boss's Inner Punster before I insisted that we all be put on the same case.
4,0,0,I'm the one who does all the heavy lifting!!
4,0,0,I know Hillary said it takes a village, but using three of us to lug his cigars around is a little much.
4,0,0,Thanks for the help with my new iPhone.
3,0,0,They're so big, it's a shame to call them briefs.
4,0,0,He's not heavy; he's our brother.
1,2,1,Actually, the deal died days ago....we're the pallbearers.
4,0,0,I think I'm going to invest in my own suitcase from now on instead of share one with the both of you.
4,0,0,This case is likely to stretch on.
2,1,1,Do you think they suspect we're cutting out early to go surfing?
3,1,0,What's your problem? The boss said he wanted a big alligator case, so we got one, capeesh?
4,1,0,This is gonna be one hell of a divorce case!
2,2,0,This is why I like powerpoint.
4,0,0,The CEO urged the shareholders to carry-on.
3,0,0,I think we've taken the carpool too far.
4,0,0,The End, Flat Stanley. The. End.
3,0,2,Democrat?
4,0,0,Psst...I'll split whatever is in the briefcase. I heard it's Donald Trumps secret cash fund.
2,1,1,What can I say? This 'sharing economy' thing has really taken off.
4,0,0,I know it's a long shot but................................
3,1,1,Don't forget, you're the one steering this bad boy.
4,0,0,Let's keep this among ourselves
4,0,0,This company is compatible with our vision.
3,0,1,This was supposed to be a job for one-handed couriers.
4,0,0,What you looking at?
1,1,1,You think anyone noticed the huge luggage so far.
4,0,0,I told you this "group work" would be a great idea, now we have other people to blame if there's a mess up.
5,0,0,The inflation here has made these graft checks a little cumbersome.
4,1,0,If you stop looking at me like that, maybe she won’t realize it’s a corpse.
4,0,0,It’s the only discreet way for hauling party-sized hoagies.
3,1,0,Threesomes are all the rage now.
3,1,0,As you can see with our new patented Casket Compression Technology™ pallbearing becomes a breeze.
5,0,0,Well she gave us a look...what's her problem?
4,0,0,we worked at my house last week, ever since we started working from home it seems like its always my week.
4,0,0,I suppose she thinks a WOMAN should hold the next handle!
5,0,0,I just crop dusted the entire elevator.
4,0,0,I think we should propose a merger of equals
2,2,0,''We are not taking a bus.''
3,0,1,God, I hate group projects!
3,1,0,Don't look at me, i'm just the middleman.
4,0,0,You know - maybe three is a crowd, but two couldn't carry this thing, and it's an important presentation.
3,0,1,Oh, good--now we can get in the HOV hallway.
3,2,0,You're on the wrong side again Larry.
2,1,1,Somehow, I never envisioned myself as part of a lawyer three pack from Costco.
4,0,0,So just who selected the super-ultra-mega legal size paper anyway?
3,1,0,Don't you love this not so briefcase?
3,1,0,You've really lightened our caseload.
1,2,1,What? You never heard of file sharing?
3,1,0,Do you think they'll suspect anything?
4,0,0,We'll need a fourth partition once Jimmy signs the new lease.
3,1,0,You mock our corporate teambuilding exercise by walking on the wrong side.
4,0,0,I prefer my rideshare
3,1,0,I hadn't anticipated having to make room for a fourth person in there.
1,2,1,When we get to the airport, let me do the talking.
2,2,0,It's a case, but it's not a brief case.
5,0,0,Old-boy briefcase.
4,0,0,It may not be the briefest, but at least it gets the job done.
1,2,1,Did you see that look on her face after I told her we work for ACME sex toys?
2,1,1,By the way, Collins- welcome to the firm of Collins, Collins, and Collins.
3,0,1,When will our hands hit puberty?
3,1,0,What we lack in brevity, we make up in team spirit.
2,3,0,It's great to have you on this case!
2,0,1,It's quite an honor to carry Mr. Trump's briefcase.
4,0,0,New top secret weapon: Death by Powerpoint
4,0,0,You're not carrying your load.
3,2,0,How did I get in the middle of this?
3,1,0,This is a lot of work just to sneek a protester into the Trump rally.
3,0,1,Being your own man? Overrated.
4,0,0,Don't worry it's not going to move t
3,0,1,First big case?
2,1,1,The key to a successful robbery is to act normal.
2,2,0,Yeah, but just wait until you see the new legal pads!
3,1,0,It seemed like a good idea at the time.
4,0,0,I thought I said one Hero sandwich for each of us.
4,0,0,I understand getting rid of offices for cubicles, I even understand a common rest room, but making us share the briefcase seems almost anti-Trump.
3,1,0,It's a three piece suitcase.
5,0,0,Why am I always middle suit?
3,1,0,I think it is going to be a long drawn out case
3,2,0," THIS WILL NOT BE BRIEF " !
3,1,0,Actually, Bill, it's quite rare for an extended case to have a single middle man.
4,1,0,I can't believe I'm working for the NRA. I can't believe I'm about to meet a senator. Hey, what's in this briefcase anyway?
5,0,0,It is what it is.
4,0,0,We're holding it together, aren't we?
4,1,0,Which way are you heading? I'm going uptown.
3,0,0,The new OSHA rule requires a minimum of three executives when carrying a briefcase.
3,0,1,.... I told you we would share this big case with you and I meant it...."
4,0,0,You know, we were all supposed to get the same haircut too.
3,1,0,I understand carpooling and sharing rooms, but this is absurd.
4,0,0,It always takes three valets to carry Ms. Kardashian's girdle tote.
4,0,0,It could be extra-long spaghetti or even peacock feathers, you never know.
4,1,0,Think of us as The Three Litigateers.
4,1,0,Two lefts don't make a right.
4,0,1,I almost forgot today was Take Your Pallbearer To Work Day
3,1,0,You're just not a team player, are you?
3,1,0,It's a harp. This elevator stops at the heaven level.
4,0,0,Did I tell you we're going on vacation next week?
3,1,0,No case too big
2,1,0,They said it would take about three attorney's to handle this case...
4,0,0,I was so alone.
3,1,0,You'll only be able to see files I'm sharing with him
4,0,0,Don't worry, they won't suspect a thing.
1,1,1,Tell him these nuclear codes are getting ridiculous.
4,0,0,We're decoys; the real stuff is going out the back door.
3,0,0,this working as a 'trio' really sucks
1,0,3,This looks like it's going to be a long drawn-out case.
3,0,1,This job sharing isn’t what I thought.
4,0,0,Wait till David sees Goliath's case.
4,0,0,I get that your trombone broke. But do we really have to carry it like we are pallbearers?
4,0,0,Dibs on the pudding cup.
3,1,0,Toasted, Triple Long Sub, with everything on it.
5,0,0,Today we dine at Subway...
4,0,0,I think she thought you looked pretty weird.
3,1,0,It was only a matter of time for Airbnb to get into the funeral business.
4,0,0,So much better than each of us carrying 3 briefcases...
3,2,0,Sorry, I called shotgun.
4,0,0,If we weren't interns, we'd wouldn't have to share a desk.
2,2,0,Ever handled a case this big?
5,0,0,Is it too late now to say sorry? 'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh.
1,3,0,It's a big case.
3,1,0,I think they have taken the teamwork concept too far.
4,0,0,You are only a fraternal twin, so get your own briefcase.
4,0,0,Say what you will about the merger Bill, it is expected to promote synergy.
2,2,0,Yes, mobile massage therapist is quite a change of direction, but ironically the whole hit-man thing was stressing me out.
5,0,0,This collaborative overload isn't going to carry itself.
3,2,0,I am sick of being just the middle man.
5,0,0,Theirs are just briefer.
4,0,0,I've decided that I won't be making any more SkyMall purchases with you.
4,0,0,It's the longest case we've ever worked on.
3,1,0,I feel funny bringing him into work this way.
3,1,0,The elevator is easy...lets see if you can survive the revolving door!
4,0,0,I know Harry was fired today. I just hope that this is Harry's trombone and not Harry.
3,1,0,I can assure you, this will not be brief.
4,0,0,Weren't we a team before this exercise?
1,3,0,Sorry, but Charlie and I don't need to go to the bathroom right now.
4,0,0,Call it what you want. It's still just a really big sandwich.
4,0,0,I think people are starting to get the wrong idea.
3,1,0,And then the bartender asked us, 'Why the long case?'
4,0,0,I have my shift at 5:00 and a concert at 4:00.
5,0,0,Can't wait for this executive training to be over and we get our own briefcases.
4,0,0,Who gets to carry Jimmy Hoffa around next year?
4,0,0,Holding up your end of the deal gets tricky on the commute.
3,1,0,Didn't the prosecuting attorney say that three of us should handle the case?
4,1,0,Whose passport will we use at TSA?
4,0,0,It's the 'Executive Executive Executive' edition.
5,0,0,Taking teamwork to a whole new level.
3,0,0,Mary's presentation had too many slides for my taste.
3,0,0,You have the left's perspective on some big issues.
4,0,0,We're glad you were assigned to the big case. We needed another guy.
4,0,0,It didn't work for the Romans either.
3,1,0,Who knew triple bottom line accounting would be so popular?
4,0,0,Yup, flat as a pancake.
3,1,0,Checked or Carry-on?
4,0,0,Geez! Clemenza didn't need a machine gun case this big.
3,1,0,I'm beginning to hope it's a gun.
3,1,0,Whose house tonight?
3,0,0,Thanks guys. I have a few CVS receipts to submit with my expense report.
4,1,0,Mom said we should all start sleeping in separate bedrooms.
4,0,0,Next time we don't use Amazing Enzo the Escapist as our getaway guy.
4,0,0,I'm telling you. Briefcase pooling is going to be the next big thing.
4,0,0,Spray tan?
4,0,1,I don't care if you're right arm is an orthotic, you need to be on this side.
5,0,0,Next time I'll get one with two handles.
4,0,0,Bob, why did they put the sub in a briefcase?
4,0,0,This isn't too noticeable right?
4,0,0,They really took the company merger seriously, huh?
4,0,0,And why would three people be needed to carry a trombone?
4,0,0,She said we're over-compensating for the size of our hands.
4,1,0,Straighten your tie, Tommy. It's causing people to stare at us.
2,1,1,We all share the same baggage

4,0,0,Will it fit in the overhead compartment?

3,1,0,This corporate team-building thing has gone way too far.
4,0,0,Bill Gates said the "middle man" would be extinct.
3,1,0,No, it's the 31st. Your turn starts tomorrow.
4,0,0,Why do you think they call it "the 'Xenophone' ?
3,1,0,It looked a lot cooler on the Sky Mall website.
3,0,1,Has it occurred to you that I'm always in the middle?
4,0,0,Does this equate to larger paychecks?
5,0,0,The Sharing Economists
4,0,0,Poll Bearers
4,0,0,You hear those downsizing rumors?
5,0,0,Do I have to attend all three meetings?
4,0,0,Ivana. Your mom?
4,0,0,Who says laptops have to keep getting smaller?
4,0,0,Hansen has the ball, and Shortz has the paddles!
4,0,0,I don't think security has a profile for you in this configuration.
1,2,1,This is not what I meant when I suggested we have a three-way!
3,0,1,I need to go to the men's room
3,1,0,I miss being a human centipede.
2,1,1,I'm so already over the sharing economy.
2,2,0,It's a new feature of our work share program.
4,1,0,After a while, you really get used to the job sharing program here.
3,1,1,I think this job sharing thing has gotten out of hand.
3,2,0,I wonder what other atrocities await us during New Accountant Initiation.
4,0,0,Who sets up Gumby when we get in there?
2,0,2,It's the biggest case I've handled.
4,0,0,If you ask me, Uber's briefcase sharing service leaves a lot to be desired.

2,2,0,Think they'll figure out we are not a string quartet any more?
3,0,0,I love carpooling with you guys, but I don't think I'm ready for this next step.
4,0,0,Now do you believe in economies of scale?
4,0,0,The boss wants this to go smoothly.
4,1,0,I agreed to the carpool and the time-share vacation condo, but this is totally ridiculous!
4,0,0,They can't outsource this overseas.
2,1,1,Your first time filing a 1040 long form?
5,0,0,Carpooling was a good idea, Karl. I'm not so sure about this one though...
3,0,1,We were told to deliver it to the Trump book depository.
4,0,0,I tired of working on this "Flat Tax" proposal
4,1,0,Have you read our annual report? 'Pallbearer' is an appropriate job title for us.
3,0,1,The D.A. said that this would be a long case.
2,1,1,We have long legal briefs.
3,1,1,I don't think you're on the right side here, Smedley!
3,1,0,Hey - there's no 'I' in team.

4,0,0,I always thought you were also left handed
4,0,0,Real men use Big Boy attaché cases.
4,0,0,4 on one briefcase?!? That's absurd.
4,0,0,Since we are all dress alike, we are sure to land this new gig!

4,0,0,What ever happened to one riot, one Ranger?
4,0,0,In case you were wondering, you're in the back because you are the new guy.
2,1,1,First time as an Executive Pallbearer?
2,2,0,I hate being in the middle, I hate that we all dress alike, and I hate that you’re always on the other side. Other than that I think we make a great team.
2,1,1,Look. We're paid to stretch things out.
3,1,0,I'm serious dude, no more tuna sandwiches.
5,0,0,You think they'll agree to our terms?
3,0,1,He lost Florida to Trump and goes home to rest.
3,1,0,Are you sure Hank done it this way?
4,0,0,...remember, Bob's gonna say, "But these chopsticks are too short!," and that's when you start the Coldplay song.
2,1,1,Yes, Jeff, I get it -- you're a manager. But you're not a *middle* manager.
4,0,0,Mr. Trump's comb.

0,1,2,I'm a little worried about the revolving door in the lobby.
4,0,0,This doesn't look suspicious at all. I told you we should have taken the stairs. Where do you bury bad bosses anyway?
1,1,2,Are you sure they won't miss him at our next meeting?
3,0,1,Hey... Group project means "Group Project"!
5,0,0,It's MBT: "Management By Triage"
3,1,0,XXL legal pads

4,1,0,This invention sounded better at the bar.
4,0,0,I specifically told both of you not to wear the same suits for the second meeting.
2,0,2,It's our latest smartphone.
4,0,0,For the last time; BIG ideas need require a BIG briefcase.
1,3,1,You know, I think I'm getting a handle on middle management.
4,0,0,Don't you think this Shared Economy thing has gone too far?
3,1,0,I love being your kid to work day.
4,0,0,Looks like we bought the same exact suitcase.
4,0,0,It's a partial list of next years African American Oscar nominees.
4,0,0,I had to let Fred go when I was "right-sized" to a five octave.
4,0,0,It's like Uber for briefcases.
3,1,0,At the count of three we release the boa constrictor.
3,1,0,Tandem briefcases are all the rage in Milan.
3,0,1,The boss is really serious about his pool sticks!

3,2,0,If anyone asks, you're my nephew.
2,2,1,I can't wait to meet our wife.
3,0,1,This company has the weirdest team-building exercise for new hires, don't you think?
4,0,0,Later we're handling the Johnson vs. Fisher case.
4,0,0,What makes you think anyone would sit through a presentation of FOLDING yardsticks?
3,1,0,Another day at United Pallbearers.
4,0,0,Where do you want to set up?
4,0,0,Next time, you get the middle handle.
0,4,1,His last wishes were to be buried in paperwork.
2,1,0,This provision of the merger is OK. The wives' clause I'm not so sure about.
3,0,0,Excellent idea, Bruce, to skip the fanny pack.
4,0,0,Do you think the matching suits are too much?
4,0,0,Look important and nobody will know that we are delivering a 3 foot sub to the boss.
4,0,0,Because extra-legal activity requires extra-legal size paper.
4,0,0,This is carrying job sharing too far.
2,2,0,This isn't what I had in mind when they said that we're merging companies.
4,0,0,Someone heard attache case.
4,0,0,I resent your disintermediation suggestions.
4,0,0,For a T-Rex, it's awfully light.
4,0,0,Yes, the iPhone 33S requires 3 people to carry it, but it fits so many apps on one screen!
2,2,0,So you're the new guy.
4,0,0,I understand why the company requires us to share the hotel room, but one suitcase?
4,1,0,Bathroom breaks are tricky, it's best if you hold it until the end of the day.
3,0,1,Anorexia
4,0,0,I guess I should have told you that the client really prefers left-handed accountants.
4,0,0,You'vd been snooping in my files.
4,0,1,Can we stop calling ourselves as the Human Centipede of tax law?
4,0,0,You forgot the missile launch codes ??!! Uh oh. Me too.
4,0,0,I said Three on a Match not Three on a Latch
4,1,0,Do we really need to file this brief together?
3,1,1,Did you remember the iron?
4,0,0,Just remember, you're only the Third Attaché!
2,1,1,I think the benefits of file sharing were grossly exaggerated.
2,2,0,He's big on mergers.
3,1,0,Our vacations are even more interesting.
5,0,0,This shouldn't take very long.
1,3,0,Work hard and one day you'll get to the middle.
3,1,0,I think we are in for a long case.
4,0,0,I get the whole open floor plan, no cubicle thing, but sharing a briefcase is taking it a bit too far!
4,0,0,We share a hoagie.
3,0,1,And it triples our billable hours.
3,0,1,Could you try to keep your Hi Ho's in time!
4,0,0,It's a long brief.
4,0,0,This time we whack the Big Guy.
3,1,0,All the cool girls are going to be in absolute awe of our xylophone concerto !
2,2,0,We use it as a battering ram to break down barriers to white men.
4,0,0,I hear it contains an alternate ending to "the sopranos"
5,0,0,If you don't get yourself in rhythm, Tom, we're going to have to find ourselves a coxswain.
4,0,0,No more Team-Building Retreats for me!
4,0,0,It's important that we carry our own weight at this company.
3,2,0,I still get funny looks when I'm the middle man !
5,0,0,If his body was any bigger it wouldn't have fit in here.
3,0,1,Remember, the trick is to act invisible.
2,1,1,I know, right? It's a new OSHA reg when moving a tripod.
3,1,0,Can you remind me if this is a billiard or snooker tournament?
4,0,0,I'll be Curly this time.
4,0,0,Just wait 'til you see the bathrooms.
3,1,0,Don't take what she said personally. We have small hands too.
5,0,0,We used to play with Hendrix.
4,0,0,"It's the sharing economy." That's all they said.
4,0,0,On April 15 I use the long form.
4,1,0,I'll keep my conversation brief, but I know with you that's not the case.
4,0,0,Clarinet trio
4,0,0,Next time, learn to play the flute!
2,2,0,You're right. The HOV elevator is faster.
1,2,0,He insisted on a wide screen presentation.
4,0,0,I don't think we thought this mobile office thing through.
5,0,0,I believe in teamwork, but this is carrying it a little too far.
2,0,2,I've been having a hard time managing my caseload lately.
3,0,1,I've always wanted to be a pallbearer.
3,1,0,I told you this is the perfect way to steal an ironing board from a hotel.
4,0,0,Should we still put him in the trunk?
4,0,0,Why am I always in the middle?
5,0,0,Anarchist
2,2,0,Remember when all we needed was a violin case and a tommy gun?
5,0,0,It's not the size of the briefcase that matters . . . it's how many people it takes to carry it.
4,0,0,One day you'll understand what it feels like to have to train your own replacements.
4,0,0,He was short and very slender.
4,1,0,I hope to make First Handle in five years.
