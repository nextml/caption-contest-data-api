16,3,1,I feel we may have interpreted "hold on to your hats" a little too literally.
19,7,3,Besides, by definition, an actual robbery can't be of play money.
16,4,1,The Sheriff rocks!
14,2,1,I'll go for a driverless hobbyhorse in the next race.
17,9,1,Hey... they are using real guns!
17,9,1,Hold your horsies. I think we're going the wrong way.

18,4,3,I think we lost them – unless of course they ditch the horses and walk over to us
13,4,0,I don't think 'hobby' suffices. These horses are really more of a passion for me.
23,10,5,They're gaining on us Zeke, let's split up!
11,0,0,Dang! We've been rockin' hard all day and they're still gainin' on us!
