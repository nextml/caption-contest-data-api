Unfunny,Somewhat funny,Funny,Caption
3,0,0,Don't worry, all they have on you is loitering.
4,0,0,My advice? Plead the fifth.
4,0,0,To be honest things look grim, real grim.
4,0,0,The prosecution is going to ask for a larger court room so that they can present their 40 truckload list of alleged victims.
4,0,0,So your defense plea is that, he was on your doorstep trying to cheat you?
2,2,0,I just really think you should have gone with a coat and tie.
2,2,0,And to think, they called me an empty suit!
4,0,0,...and i was like, dude, we both know that you never even finished the first episode of the larry sanders show, so i don't know why you're pretending to be so mad at me
3,0,0,Does this mean life!
4,0,0,You're dead.
3,1,0,Didn't you get the suit I left with your doorman?
4,0,0,Yeah, I said you don't have to testify, but you do have to appear.
4,0,0,You'll have to get yourself off death row.
3,1,0,Your job is to testify during the penalty phase.
4,0,0,We just need to leave room for reasonable doubt. If the cloak doesn't fit, you must acquit!
3,1,0,You can't just hang the jury.
4,0,0,This time, let's scare them
1,1,2,Remember: you tell the jury you were just doing your job.
3,1,0,Bad nose job or not, this outfit isn't helping our case
1,1,1,It looked like you convinced the older jurors.
4,0,0,Well good thing for you you didn't kill all the lawyers
3,0,1,They want the death penalty.
3,0,0,They're saying he bought the super size soda from a machine not a restaurant so we may not need you here.
2,2,0,Are you here to tell me I'm on death row?
3,0,1,I agree, but they're not going to compromise despite how surreal it'll be.
4,0,0,I'm pretty sure I can get the terrorism charge dismissed, but the TSA and the judge aren't buying your "farm implement" excuse...
3,0,0,Call Lucifer and tell him to arrange a continuance.
2,2,0,Just because it's a death penalty case doesn't mean I need a second chair!
4,0,0,You need to sharpen your Scythe We are going for the death penalty!
2,1,1,How do you feel about capital punishment?
4,0,0,Unfortunately, there's legal doctrine that prohibits inheritance by a person who murders someone from whom he or she stands to inherit.
3,0,0,No, 'untill death do us part' was binding
3,0,0,The State of Texas cannot execute you a second time.
3,1,0,I think plea bargaining for "life" would be pushing it.
2,1,0,We are going for assisted suicide.
4,0,0,We'll plead solo.
4,0,0,The jury might be more sympathetic if you didn't insist on wearing that hoodie.
4,0,0,I suggest we petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
3,1,0,Its 'Death and Taxes', not 'Death or Taxes'.
3,1,0,I'm not gonna lie. The odds look pretty grim.
2,1,1,If I get you out of this, can you promise me I'll never see you again?
4,0,0,We're good-this judge is pro-death penalty.
3,0,0,The Jury Hates Your Hoodie
3,1,0,I'm not sure how I could get you life.
3,1,0,Go ahead - I think you should try on the gloves.
1,2,1,I'm glad you took my advice to leave the scythe at home.
4,0,0,I can get it reduced to manslaughter.
3,1,0,You do realize you're looking at life here?
4,0,0,I suppose the death penalty won’t be a problem for you.
4,0,0,I think we can plea it down to a lie sentence.
4,0,0,I presume you're taking the Fifth?
4,0,0,You may want to lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Might help with the jury if you had a nickname other than "Grim." How do you feel about "Scooter"?
3,1,0,I think it was a mistake to call Famine, Pestilence, and War as your character witnesses...
4,0,0,Our only hope is a hung jury.
2,1,1,When you identify the perpetrator, don't point.
2,2,0,Sooner or later, you're going to have to face it.
4,0,0,This trial is killing me.
3,0,1,I think the death penalties a given.
4,0,0,Trust me, they can't sentence you to you.
3,1,0,We'll argue mistaken identity.
3,1,0,Yes Mr. Reaper, "the dead" can file a class action suit against you.
2,2,0,Just say you're looking for the real killers.
4,0,0,I'm not putting you on the stand; they'll see right through you.
4,0,0,If anyone can get you off the hook, it's Faust & Faust.
3,0,0,When I said "hung jury," I was only speaking figuratively.
3,1,0,So the verdict is in.
1,2,0,Try to look sorry.
2,1,1,Yes. Definitely no witnesses.
2,2,0,Don't worry, I'm experienced in wrongful termination.
2,1,1,OK, I get you 30 years and you give me 30 years and we'll call it even.
3,1,0,Next time wear the tie I gave you.
4,0,0,You know, this whole case hinges on the jury being able to see what you're really made of.
3,1,0,Remember, "if the scythe doesn't fit, you must acquit."
4,0,0,No smiling when the eye witness takes the stand.
3,0,1,You may have to face a jury
4,0,0,they will ask you to state your full name for the record
3,1,0,Unfortunately, the “inevitability of death” is not a valid legal defense to murder.
2,2,0,Best case scenario, we get a hung jury
2,1,0,You're sure you want to play the habeas corpus card?
3,1,0,Cool it. That vacant stare gives me the creeps.
2,2,0,I think it would be in your best interest to avoid using your nickname.
3,1,0,Look on the bright side -- in 20 years this'll make a great crime drama.
1,3,0,Seriously, sir. I want the death penalty
4,0,0,My client pleads the privilege against self-recrimination.
2,2,0,Of course I trust in your innocence, but I beg you to look the other way!
3,1,0,The worst case scenario is a Life sentence.
4,0,0,Let's tell the judge that you were only doing your job.
4,0,0,You forgot your tie again.
4,0,0,This is Traffic Court, it is NOT a death penalty case!
1,2,0,I should warn you that everyone is trying to cheat you
4,0,0,Please! You can't let them give me the life penalty. I still have so much more to do in death.
3,0,1,It's not you. It's your name. This is a political correctness trial. They now want to call you, "The Reaper".
4,0,0,We can probably assume that the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,Absolutely not! No threats to the prosecutor.
0,4,0,If you take the plea deal they'll give you life.
3,1,0,Now be nice! Remember the jurors are also future clients.
2,2,0,So, what happened to your last lawyer?
2,2,0,Not bringing the scythe into court was a good call.
4,0,0,You know, you're really not making my job easier with this routine, Mr. Shkreli." "I plead the 5th.
3,1,0,Why aren't you wearing the glasses I got you?
4,0,0,Why do the court think I'm responsible for Wall Street shorts?
4,0,0,What? You said to wear a killer suit.
3,1,0,Lose the hoodie—it's too thuggish.
2,2,0,Our only chance is if you can make eye contact with every juror.
2,0,1,Think positive!
4,0,0,The judge said that feeling hollow inside is not an adequate defense.
4,0,0,There is no such thing as a writ of habeas corpse
4,0,0,Sure it’s unfair, but juries in this town are biased against the angel of death.
4,0,0,I suggest we both waive our fees.
4,0,0,Don't answer any questions about taxes. Death you can talk about.
1,3,0,Yes, I understand it's 'comfy' however...
3,1,0,Well, at least we know the prosecution wont't seek the death penalty...
1,2,0,So you think self defense is the best way to go here?
4,0,0,Ubiquity isn't going to work as an alibi.
3,0,0,And try to keep a non-threatening expression on your face.
3,1,0,How do you feel about a life sentence?
4,0,0,Another accident, huh? The judge won't let you plead The Fifth again!
4,0,0,This plea deal will knock a few thousand years off your sentence.
3,1,0,I don't think the jury will buy the self defense argument
4,0,0,Your choice; the electric chair or the scythe.
3,1,0,OK. They’ve assembled a new jury. No more frog curses.
4,0,0,I don't want the last meal !
4,0,0,I am NOT Eddie Rickenbacker; I am your lawyer!
4,0,0,Well, the IRS is certain you did not pay these taxes.
2,1,1,I should be able to get you off with a death sentence.
3,1,0,We'd like to request a brief recess to, uh, kill your Honor.
3,1,0,I told you. Being invisible and in her bedroom is not a defense to the charge of being a peeping tom.
2,2,0,Where's my client?
2,2,0,I can't keep objecting each time they say, "Death Penalty."
3,0,0,I'm not sure the jury is going to like you.
4,0,0,The only two things in life that are certain are death and taxes. That's why we want to hire you.
3,0,0,Were you being honest when you said you didn't kill him?
3,1,0,Headless horseman defense will not work
1,1,2,They all seem anxious to cut a deal.
3,0,0,Just answer the questions clearly and directly, and remember, no pointing.
4,0,0,Remember to maintain good eye contact with the jurors.
3,1,0,I recommend not taking the stand.
4,0,0,"I'm afraid you're going to have to face the music".
4,0,0,This will most likely be my last death penalty case.
4,0,0,I thought you, of all people, would speak Latin.
4,0,0,Are you sure you didn't do anything to Scrooge?
4,0,0,The word is 'nolo', not 'yolo'.
3,1,0,Luckily, in this state there is no penalty for death.
4,0,0,Ahhh the hoodie! I told you not to wear the hoodie.
4,0,0,So you're missing Trump's IQ gene...
2,2,0,I just worry that the hoodie makes you look a little suspicious.
2,2,0,Mr Reaper, I wouldn't advise taking the fifth if I were you...
4,0,0,Remember, not a word about the chess match.
3,1,0,Understand, you're looking at life.
4,0,0,The DA nixed the chess match deal.
4,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying into the domestic abuse defense.
2,1,1,It's hard to put a good face on this.
4,0,0,Yes, Mr. Scrooge is suing for defamation. All you have to do is nod and point.
2,0,1,So how do you feel about the color orange?
2,1,1,Don't look so grim, you always win in the end.
4,0,0,I thought this was business casual. I wore my hoodie.
2,1,0,Let me guess...A wrongful death suit?
4,0,0,'I got the trial delayed until tax season so your crimes wouldn't seem so bad."
3,1,0,Look, I've done all I can, but the jury needs to hear you testify.
4,0,0,You don't have much of a murder case here, I think we should go with insanity.
4,0,0,I know, but please just say, "Not guilty, Your Honor."
2,1,0,I know you're an expert witness, but this is a TAX case.
3,1,0,We could cut a deal if you tell me where Taxes is hiding out.
3,1,0,Please don't make eye contact with any of the jurors....that is, if in fact you actually have eyes.
4,0,0,You're lucky they abolished the death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,Apparently we did need to make a distinction between 'Reaper' and 'Reapist'
4,0,0,Hoods aren't allowed in court.
4,0,0,So, I just need to touch your robe to get out of here?
3,1,0,What was it you said your name was again?
4,0,0,Tax evasion? I mean, you of all people.
4,0,0,We'll try to avoid the you penalty....
1,2,0,Unfortunately, they can still charge with tax evasion.
3,0,1,When you take the stand, I'm calling you 'Jim'
4,0,0,You realize it will be hard for you to deny these accusations.
3,0,1,Try to smile more for the jury.
2,0,1,That's your idea of business casual?
4,0,0,I think our best bet is for you to just plead the 5th
3,0,0,The whole innocent until proven guilty thing will go smoother if you lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Better bring the pitchfork tomorrow.
2,1,0,Good news! I think he's going to give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,Naturally, it would be awkward if they sentence you to death.
3,0,0,Alright! Another death penalty!
4,0,0,They don't have a case without the scythe.
4,0,0,As he looked into the face of Death; Hanratty had second thoughts about bringing up the subject of "Billable Hours" to his client.
4,0,0,Don't worry, we've got a jury to die for.
3,1,0,Who are plaintiffs? Well...I guess everybody.
4,0,0,If all else fails, challenge the Judge to a game of chess.
4,0,0,Don't let them rattle you; they call me an empty suit too.
3,0,0,"We're Killing It!
3,1,0,So this is how you reward me for getting you out on bail
1,2,0,When you look at the jury, try not to look so grim.
3,1,0,Next time try to remember: Death AND taxes
2,1,0,I'll tell the judge you were only doing your job
2,2,0,I can get you a new identity.
4,0,0,Luckily, capital punishment doesn't apply in your case!
2,1,0,In case anyone asks, I've never seen you before in my life.
3,1,0,Wait, you name is Tom?
2,1,1,The eye witness could be a problem.
3,1,0,Let's see if I can talk them down to accessory after the fact.
3,0,0,The fact that it's your job does not constitute a legal defense.
3,1,0,Look, I've already told you that we can't say you were "just helping him cross the rainbow bridge".
3,1,0,When you say I'd better win this case, what exactly do you mean...?
2,1,0,What about our 'right to life' issue?
3,1,0,You're right. The hoodie does make you less threatening.
4,0,0,What about those I should have gotten already but are still sitting in your death row cells?
4,0,0,How about, 'If the hoodie doesn’t fit, you must acquit!'?
4,0,0,Because I think if we bring up your zombie days you'l have a better chance.
3,0,0,Sir, IRS offers you a payment plan.
2,2,0,What happens if the sentence is life imprisonment?
3,1,0,There's no prima facie case.
4,0,0,No magistrate in the country will convict you—you were just supervising.
3,1,0,You probably could get a hung jury but not the way you're thinking of.
2,2,0,We can't lose; they don't have the Death penalty in this state.
2,1,1,With this jury, you could get life.
4,0,0,I'm afraid things are looking a bit grim, Grim.
4,0,0,What I'm saying is that, as a defense, "it was his time" doesn't give me a lot to work with here.
2,1,0,Eternity is the best sentence we can hope for.
4,0,0,123456788
4,0,0,Thanks again for flying up from Texas on such short notice to handle my appeal.
4,0,0,It looks bad for you, but at least the Death Penalty is off the table
4,0,0,I don't think the Sicilian defense is going to work.
3,1,0,We're looking at life without parole. They're looking at death without a scythe.
3,1,0,They think you could be useful on death row.
3,1,0,You're killing me with this "for all eternity" talk.
3,0,1,My top priority is making sure you don't get the you penalty.
1,2,0,Sorry. Only the judge is allowed to wear a robe.
3,1,0,I gotta say, the case looks grim.
4,0,0,Have you pissed anyone off?
4,0,0,What happened to the emoji I told you to wear?
4,0,0,hey bro
3,1,0,I doubt they'll go for the death penalty.
3,0,0,They want to sentence you to life. How ironic is that?
3,1,0,I assume you have no problem with the death penalty?
1,0,3,It looks grim, no doubt about it.
4,0,0,I think you lost the jury when you ended with "Have a nice day."
3,1,0,It's "inevitable" and "would you rather pay taxes" are not good defenses.
2,0,2,Probably a mistrial; we couldn't find a jury of your peers.
2,1,0,The case is starting to look a bit grim.
2,1,1,If you're lucky, you'll get the death penalty.
2,1,0,Help me. I do not approve of capital punishment.
3,0,1,Professional courtesy doesn’t exempt you from taxes.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I worked for Robert Shapiro in the 90s.
3,1,0,They're calling a fingerprint expert for the scythe.
4,0,0,I thimk you should listen to me in this case, a hoodie is a no goodie in court.
3,0,1,...And the last possibile outcome is that you receive the ultimate punishment--the Life Penalty.
3,1,0,The bad news - this is not a class action suit. The good news - the death penalty is off the table, suicide is against the law.
3,1,0,Just stay quiet and the committee with talk themselves to death.
2,2,0,Worst case scenario, you get a life sentence.
1,2,0,You're not proud, are you?
1,0,0,It's better for our case that you agreed to leave the scythe at home.
2,1,0,I think you should lower the hood. We want to convey sincerity.
3,1,0,I don't feel like I am representing you in the best light.
4,0,0,So, how innocent can you afford to be?
2,0,1,Not quite what I meant when I suggested you wear business attire.
2,2,0,I see this isn't the first time you've faced life.
4,0,0,If the sickle doesn't show, you must let go!
2,1,0,Try not to look so grim.
3,0,1,Yes, you... and taxes.
4,0,0,I understand these Police Body-Camera's are bad for business but maybe we should cut down a tad?
3,0,1,You do realize that my client is charged with loitering, don't you?
1,2,1,Take the plea or it's life.
4,0,0,Your files came with this really long suitcase.
2,1,0,No, no. They're saying they want to give YOU the death penalty.
3,1,0,Actually, a life sentence would be an absolution.
4,0,0,It will be hard to argue against the death penalty, especially when wearing a hoody in front of the jury.
3,0,0,I'm afraid there's no dodging the tax evasion charges.
3,1,0,Lucky for us they got no fingerprints off the scythe.
4,0,0,The next time you're questioned, try to avoid the maniacal laughter
3,0,1,I thought we agreed on sweater vest with button down and tie.
2,1,0,Could you explain how playing cowbell for Blue Oyster Cult is not relevant to this case?
3,0,0,The good news is if you take the stand we might end up with a hung jury.
1,0,1,If we win, Death be not proud.
3,1,0,Is the plea bargain still on the table?
3,1,0,Your fingerprints were on the chess board.
2,0,0,This case is going to be the death of me.
4,0,0,We've got nothing to worry about - I convinced the prosecution that we'll only accept the death penalty if you're found guilty.
3,1,0,They had it coming
4,0,0,Yeah, but after the "Raise your right hand" part, I thought you really loosened up.
3,1,0,The only character witness we could find is Scrooge.
2,1,0,You've heard "You reap what you sow"?
4,0,0,Why yes, my last name is Baggins.
4,0,0,I suggest for your opening statement you take the hood off...
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'll tie them up in litigation forever!
3,0,1,Why didn't you tell me about the scythe?
3,1,0,The just-following-orders defense has not worked since the Nuremberg trials.
4,0,0,We've got to drag this out. January, and Baby New Year will be out to vouch for you.
2,1,0,Well, at least it wasn't the death penalty.
4,0,0,Honestly, that "eyes are the windows of the soul" doesn't matter in court.
4,0,0,We have to make you appear likable.
3,0,0,It would help your case if you took off that robe.
1,2,1,Ironically, you are looking at life
4,0,0,But your testimony would be deadly!
2,2,0,And try not to ask the judge where he got his robe this time.
3,0,1,I still think a suit and tie would work better.
4,0,0,If we get even one smoker on that jury, we've got a shot.
4,0,0,Something tells me you know which way the jury is leaning.
3,0,0,It wouldn’t kill you to smile a little more around the jury.
4,0,0,As your lawyer, I strongly advise that your case will go better for you if you lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,When I told you to take the fifth, I didn't mean dimension.
3,1,0,So - are you okay with the death penalty?
4,0,0,You've got the wrong Ebinezer.
1,2,1,You're not eligible for the death penalty.
2,2,0,Unless they can somehow tie the scythe to you, there's a good chance of acquittal.
3,1,0,You are going to be the death of me yet.
4,0,0,You should have worn your "Make America Great Again," shroud.
3,1,0,I declined the plea bargain. Let's hope you get the chair.
4,0,0,If this trial was in Manhattan, we might have a chance, but here in Brooklyn, they've outlawed death, so you're out of luck.
3,1,0,I doubt you'll get life
4,0,0,I thought you understood me when I told you not to wear your hoodie to trial.
2,1,0,Just cutting grass? No, that's not credible.
3,1,0,So you don't think it's at least a little ironic that you're here for tax evasion?
3,1,0,Nah, don't change! In your case, a hoodie is appropriate attire.
2,1,1,He said it's looking pretty grim for you.
2,2,0,With a little luck, we can cop a plea and get you life.
1,2,1,I'm hoping we can exclude your prior record.
4,0,0,The judge has denied your claim of retroactive death benefits from the beginning of time.
3,1,0,I got them down to 100 billion manslaughters.
2,0,1,Deny everything!
4,0,0,Looks like we can get them for damaging your livelihood.
4,0,0,They're having trouble finding a jury of your peers.
2,2,0,You certainly don't seem too concerned about the death sentence
2,1,1,Try not to giggle if they give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Relax, when they ask the witness to point to the accused, just pull the hoody off, I'll have you home before dinner.
4,0,0,Frankly, it's not looking good.
4,0,0,I think we should argue he's "mostly dead."
2,2,0,Telling the jury that they are welcome to the dark side is not a good idea!
2,1,1,I understand that you are just as certain as taxes. But you still have to pay them.
4,0,0,I recommend you plead the scythe.
3,1,0,Let’s start by asking the judge for community service
2,1,0,Worst case? 50 to Life.
2,1,0,Frankly, I don't think the outfit is helping us.
4,0,0,Would you like a breath mint
4,0,0,Dave, I think this is the right moment to tell you that I've been having an affair with your wife. But I'm going to have to fire you again.
3,1,0,Are you still hanging around? There's no death penalty in New York.
3,1,0,We're breaking new ground, but I've handled a lot of wrongful death cases.
4,0,0,I don't think calling War, Pestilence, and Famine as character witnesses is going to help.
3,0,1,I know you're excited, but you will not get the death penalty for tax fraud.
3,0,0,I thought we'd agreed you'd wear the blue suit.
4,0,0,All the evidence indicates that the defendant did indeed cheat you.
4,0,0,I know it's what you do, but would it kill you to wear a suit just this once?
3,0,0,Stop moaning. It's not the end of the world.
3,1,0,So, you met Justice Scalia?
4,0,0,Statute of Limitations.
3,0,1,In your case habeas corpus is more figurative.
3,1,0,I'm afraid that your chances of winning are grim.
2,0,1,Try not to look at the jury.
3,1,0,They're going for the death sentence. Try not to look happy.
3,1,0,You should have paid your taxes.
3,1,0,Look, I know how to pronounce it, but I'm still going to call you Dr. Deeth.
3,0,1,Please remember, next time wear a suit and tie.
3,1,0,Yeah, I can move for a change of venue but to where?
3,1,0,You're looking at life, pal.
1,1,1,I assume the death penalty is not an issue.
3,1,0,Don't worry. I think they will have a hard time finding a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,Ironically they're seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,I think I can get you off with life, pardon the pun, in prison.
2,1,1,Next time don't walk around the suburbs in a hoodie.
4,0,0,I think we're losing. You have an empty suit.
3,1,0,You could be facing a death penalty.
4,0,0,We Made It! DNA, Death Penalty Reversal, Immortality
3,0,1,Remember, you showed him to the gates of Hell, but he walked through by himself.
4,0,0,Honestly, it looks pretty grim, Reaper.
4,0,0,The jury's returning. Try not to look so grim.
2,2,0,On the flip side, you did invent the death penalty.
3,1,0,The good news is we're in Texas.
4,0,0,This time, you're getting 'Life.'
4,0,0,You don't give me any confidence in your legal expertise.
4,0,0,I think we should cop a plea and hope for the death penalty.
2,1,1,Don't worry; obviously, they can't ask for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Well yes, the Second Circuit is certainly an advocate for karma, but it unfortunately does not tolerate the use of a scythe on a trader outside Delmonico's.
2,2,0,That wasn't what I meant by "strike that juror."
3,1,0,Now don't go losing your head over this - juries notice every little thing.
3,1,0,We're looking at manslaughter, assisted suicide. You good with that?
4,0,0,Remember--try not to look so grim.
4,0,0,It IS life affirming. You're sentenced for life, for god's sake.
2,1,0,Now- once again-yoy're the Ghost of Christmas-What?
1,3,0,Do you have a less prejudicial outfit?
3,0,0,Stop saying things look grim.
4,0,0,You were advised to wear a suit and tie
4,0,0,Don't worry, we only have to give the jury reasonable doubt.
2,1,0,Visting a cancer ward is not a good alibi.
4,0,0,Don't worry, there's no prima facie evidence.
3,1,0,It doesn't exactly help when the penalty is named after you.
4,0,0,We may be in trouble here, they found your distal phalanx on the scythe.
2,1,1,Witnesses! That's what this case is missing and that's why we're going to win!
3,1,0,Just show a little remorse, we can probably get you a reduced sentence.
4,0,0,Don't worry. Without the scythe, they don't have a case.
4,0,0,Don't worry, I've got a call into Netflix.
3,0,1,Can anyone testify you sent them to a better place?
4,0,0,On second thought, maybe the smile is a bad idea.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, you're likely to get life.
3,0,0,If I get you out of this one, it changes everything.
3,0,0,Before he rules, the judge wants to discuss a deal. With you.
3,1,0,In the ultimate irony, they're going to sentence you to life.
2,1,1,OK. Death after life.
2,2,0,Is this your first offense?
4,0,0,I don't care that it wasn't flattering, you still should have worn the navy blue suit.
4,0,0,But she couldn't have identified me-I wasn't wearing this hoodie when I did it !
3,0,1,Would it kill you to smile?
3,1,0,Remember, a smile goes a long way.
2,2,0,Death becomes you, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
4,0,0,Death be not proud--so it's okay to take the fifth
3,1,0,No one else saw you either.
4,0,0,There's only one way out of this, drop the hoodie and show this jury you are a man of your word!
4,0,0,I think our best move here may be to claim self-defense.
3,0,0,On the
4,0,0,Bad news. You got life.
0,2,2,We'll appeal on the grounds that it's not only cruel and unusual punishment, but sort of ironic, too.
4,0,0,...asking for the death penalty is unprecedented.
4,0,0,Well, they can't accuse you of being a two faced liar.
3,0,0,Listen, everyone's a little thrown off here. The prosecution is unsure whether to try you as a serial killer, the judge can't figure out whether the death penalty even applies and my 80 year old mother who like to watch me work is plain scared.
4,0,0,Remember, witness protection can be withdrawn at the judge's discretion...
4,0,0,Hold your breath
4,0,0,This case is driving me to an early grave. Please stop smiling.
2,2,0,If you're lucky, sentencing will take an eternity.
3,1,0,You were just doing your job isn't going to cut it here.
4,0,0,Don’t do anything that might turn the jury against you.
4,0,0,And what's the worst that could happen, death row?
2,2,0,Seriously? You wear a hoodie to court?
3,0,0,I agree the Judge looks sickly but I specifically said no to the hoodie!!
4,0,0,I am sorry Mr. Scrooge, but I am afraid you may have to face the music.
2,2,0,Of course they took it away from you. What do you expect? You just harvested half the jury.
1,2,0,Be prepared to reap only what you sue.
3,0,0,"When you get called up onto the witness stand, do not make direct eye contact with any of the jurors".
1,3,0,You tell the judge to go to hell!
3,1,0,No, you're doing the closing.
3,0,0,It was revenge for loss of face.
3,0,1,If it breaks our way you could get life.
3,1,0,You"re late!
3,0,1,From what I've gathered, you're already serving multiple life sentences - what's one more.
3,0,0,We don't want the jury to see your face so keep the hoodie on
4,0,0,The sythe's a prop, okay? I wasn't brandishing a weapon.
3,1,0,as your attorney, i advise... never mind.
4,0,0,I advise we don't go for the "You Penalty"
4,0,0,I tried to tell you. "Friend of the corpse" is not a thing.
4,0,0,Normally, I'd counsel you to take the life sentence offered. But it does not become you.
2,2,0,Remember, he was dead before you got there.
4,0,0,Try not to look so grim when the judge walks in.
4,0,0,I'm certain that you will get a reduced sentence!
3,1,0,We think Grim is prejudicial so we're going with Natural Reaper.
3,0,0,You're sure she was wearing that same tulle tippet when got out of your carriage?
4,0,0,Judge did not buy your argument of Soliciting to Murder by your boss
3,1,0,Just this once take my advice and take down your profile picture and tone down your posts on Facebook.
4,0,0,Because there are no witnesses, the evidence against you is strictly circumstantial.
3,1,0,They can't see past the hoodie.
3,0,0,Yes, yes, if things go our way, you will get the death penalty.
4,0,0,Look, I still think that this is your best bet of getting Cheney.
3,1,0,I'm afraid your testimony will fall on deaf ears.
3,0,1,We're going with the "it was their time" defense.
2,2,0,We were able to negotiate additional charges for you, so you will now get death. Congratulations!
4,0,0,No, Silly, this is not a death penalty case. It's about the scheduling of the TV show "lucifer."
3,0,1,Yeah, it's the truth, but saying "No one here gets out alive" does nothing for your defence.
3,1,0,Hoodies always prejudice the jury.
3,0,0,Just be thankful they're not asking for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Our defense is, yes he steal souls; but... come on guys, he's the Grim Reaper.
4,0,0,If we lose, you may be looking at the life penalty.
3,0,0,They have eyewitnesses. There's no way they confused you with someone else.
4,0,0,Life imprisonment.
4,0,0,I should have mentioned my fees earlier--$500 an hour, and eternal life. And I get the scythe if we win.
2,1,0,I really feel like you should have worn a suit.
2,0,0,Two things - I think you should take the stand, and what was Elvis like?
4,0,0,The Jury is awarding pain and suffering damages...for themselves.
4,0,0,Win or lose, we're still going to the party.
2,0,1,After careful consideration, I agree that a zero percent contingency fee is an excellent idea.
4,0,0,I'm not going to lie to you, your future looks Grim
3,1,0,There's someone at my office I would like you to meet.
4,0,0,It's just like we practiced: "Not that I recall."
2,2,0,Judge Reynolds spares no one.
1,3,0,I'll leave the closing arguments to you.
4,0,0,I think you should plead the 5th.
4,0,0,No, this is not a death penalty case either.
4,0,0,Bit late for a call for reform of capital punishment
2,1,1,Face it, the outlook's pretty grim
4,0,0,Try not to look so vacuous when you testify.
3,0,1,I thought we talked about the hoodie.
2,2,0,Well, so much for Deflategate, coach-- but next time, ditch the hoodie
3,1,0,I understand you are cold, but a sweater would have been a better choice.
3,0,0,With all due respect, it's not exactly my fault that Johnnie Cochran was unavailable.
4,0,0,I think I can get you the death sentence.
3,1,0,I promise you won't get life.
4,0,0,Getting visitation rights will be tricky
2,1,0,I told you orange clashes with my skin tone!
2,1,1,Yes, I know that none of the witnesses could identify your face in the line-up but the scythe is pretty incriminating.
4,0,0,You could be facing the death penalty--if you had a face.
4,0,0,They're asking for death without parole.
2,1,1,Taxed to death is not a credible defense.
2,1,0,Help me out. I'm dying here.
3,0,0,I know it's a killer of a case but the hijab is just overkill.
4,0,0,I don't think you're getting out of this unscythed
4,0,0,I don't think you can take the fifth.
1,1,1,This isn't what I meant by business formal.
4,0,0,We have to prove they weren't premeditated.
4,0,0,No, you can't tamper with the jury just because they're hung.
2,2,0,I say we plea bargain for the death sentence.
3,0,0,Deal? If we pass this, can I live to see it happen?
4,0,0,Next time you Object, try saying it in your spooky voice.
3,0,0,You're spooking the jury.
3,1,0,For the last time, your plea is guilty! Being ripped off by your wireless provider is no excuse for murder.
3,1,0,You nailed it.
4,0,0,Don't look so grim Leonard-its only a minor traffic violation!
4,0,0,Don't worry. The death panalty's off the table.
3,1,0,You should have worn the suit I think.
2,1,1,You were just doing your job.
3,1,0,And you stole the scythe?
4,0,0,Can you hold off until the legal bills are paid?
2,1,1,Try not to appear excited when they ask for capital punishment.
3,1,0,We got this. There's no defense against death.
3,0,0,Good news: judge is throwing out the line up ID.
2,0,0,You of all people should have known the difference between a hung jury and a hanged jury.
3,1,0,They can't prove it's your scythe...
3,0,0,You'd rather get the death penalty and not a life sentence?
3,1,0,You're sure you want to petition the court to change your name to Robin?
4,0,0,"I was hoping for a hung jury, not a dead one!'
2,2,0,No I don't think you should take the stand!
1,3,0,OK. Check that. Maybe don't look the jury in the eye.
2,2,0,And taxes. Two things, remember?
3,0,0,They're calling it a wrongful death.
3,0,1,Any potential character witnesses?
4,0,0,Stop intimidating the witness.
4,0,0,You should have declared your stock income.
4,0,0,After this, I'm getting my taxes done. Wanna come?
3,1,0,Don't kill me, but I can't seem to find your birth certificate.
3,1,0,Remember to take the fifth when they ask your name.
2,1,0,Just tell the jurors about your troubled childhood. It always works.
4,0,0,The jury needs to get to know you as a person
2,0,1,You'll want to say you use the scythe as a weed eater.
1,2,1,The line up was clearly biased. The witness couldn't even see your face.
4,0,0,what do you mean anything but the "death" sentence ???
2,1,1,That's not what I meant by 'professional dress.'
3,1,0,Best case scenario is they give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,you have a death wish!!!
3,1,0,Don't complain. With good behavior you'll be out in one lifetime.
3,1,0,It looks good. So far it's Scrooge's word against yours.
4,0,0,With a repeat offender's record like yours, we should... What's that? You want to take the fifth?
4,0,0,You haven't a ghost of a chance with this judge.
4,0,0,You're sure you're not guilty?
4,0,0,They've got enough to put you away for life.
4,0,0,Was Immortality still in the carriage when you dropped off the hitch-hiker wearing the Tulle Tippet?
0,3,1,Yes, death is considered a penalty here.
3,0,0,Here's the deal: The DA will drop the terrorism charge... but they're not budging on Genocide 1
4,0,0,I know it hurts your brand, but we should consider the manslaughter plea.
2,2,0,That's not what I meant when I said, "wear something that makes you look serious".
3,1,0,So far, so good. Your chances look pretty grim.
4,0,0,It's cool. You'll get your scythe back on the way out.
4,0,0,When I asked if you had a dark suit, this isn't what I meant.
4,0,0,I'm telling you for the last time, the jury is not going to be impressed that Beelzebub has given you excellent performance evaluations for the last 6000 years.
3,0,0,Thanks for your vote of confidence.
4,0,0,The Judge told me to tell you that he likes your robe better than his.
4,0,0,I'll be brief...
4,0,0,The recess is just until your face grows back.
3,1,0,You plead guilty or not guilty. You can't plead for a death sentence!
3,1,0,What do you mean, "they can't identify me because I'm faceless", that's HOW they identified you.
4,0,0,The death penalty, we can be certain, is off the table.
4,0,0,You reap what you sow.
2,2,0,Remember, look chipper and make eye contact.
3,0,1,It's going well. This jury isn't going to vote against you.
1,2,0,That outfit makes you look guilty
3,1,0,Now remember, you're a tech entrepreneur and you always wear that thing.
2,2,0,No, you can't "recuse" the judge.
2,1,1,I advise you to stop pointing at members of the jury.
4,0,0,So you say you were with Scrooge at the time?
3,0,1,No fingerprints on the scythe - we're good.
4,0,0,But doesn’t a plea bargain for a life sentence seem a bit ironic?
4,0,0,Work with me here, your attitude is killing me.
2,2,0,I'm claiming you were only doing your job.
2,2,0,That's not what a hung jury means.
2,2,0,Your looking at a life sentence.
4,0,0,Don't worry, they have no positive ID on you.
4,0,0,If only we could remove juror #6
3,1,0,Pro bono, huh? Over my dead body.
4,0,0,Please stop saying you'll take the ME penalty.
2,2,0,I don’t care if it’s your “brand.” We’re trying to beat a wrongful death charge and you’re not helping.
2,1,0,Scythe, smythe. We'll never get that thing into evidence.
4,0,0,Do you have to be so dramatic? It's only a parking ticket.
4,0,0,That's a hollow argument.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, but I think there's a hole in your defense.
3,1,0,Just take it as face value! I think we can win this case.
2,2,0,Don't blame me. I told you there's no way to avoid your taxes.
3,1,0,So you think we should ask for the death sentence?
4,0,0,The cloak is not helping your case.
3,1,0,How do you feel about Life Without Parole?
2,2,0,Thanks for not bringing your scythe.
4,0,0,Don't worry, you can do a twenty year sentence on your head.
2,2,0,I'm sorry to have to be the one to break it to you, but this state no longer has the death penalty.
3,1,0,Remember to smile and make eye contact with the jury.
2,2,0,How many times do we have to go over this? It's you AND taxes.
4,0,0,My client would like to know how legally binding the term "till Death due us part" is.
3,0,1,I hope you are here to testify.
4,0,0,I don't care where you went to Law School! You representing me would be a conflict of interest!
4,0,0,I don't think jay-walking demands the death sentence.
4,0,0,It's not the death thing, it's the hoodie thing.
3,1,0,I advise you to take the 5th, as well as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th.
2,1,1,Try to be a little more approachable in front of the jury.
1,0,3,I'm ethically precluded from advising you what to do, but, yes, if their star witness were to die, the case would be dismissed.
3,0,0,But if you take it off Jamal, you're DEFINITELY going to lose.
3,1,0,No, look, we went over this already -- you *don’t* want a hung jury.
3,1,0,Remember to smile when you take the witness stand.
4,0,0,Honestly, I wouldn't worry so much about the speeding tickets.
2,1,0,.....remember now, do not bring up your involvement with Death.
2,2,0,I'll get it reduced to life.
4,0,0,What do you mean you'll give them the death penalty?
4,0,0,To a jury, death doesn't become you.
2,1,1,It would behoove you to not look into the eyes of the jury.
2,1,0,Unfortunately they have fingerprints.
3,0,0,Don't worry. The life penalty is not legal in this state.
2,1,1,Bad news: your sentence is going to be Life.
2,2,0,You might want to smile a bit more -- jurors seem to like that.
2,1,1,Whatever you do ... don't act proud.
4,0,0,The bottom line is....you didn't pay your taxes.
3,0,0,Are you crazy, of course we want the death sentence!
3,0,0,We have to prove this guy had a death wish.
4,0,0,She wants you to remove your hoodie.
2,2,0,The bad news...you got Death...the good news...you are Death.
2,1,0,We need a hung jury.
4,0,0,How come the Judge never overrules YOUR objections?
4,0,0,Do you think they'll find me guilty? They Smite
2,0,0,Appeals on behalf of morbidity have been ruled out.
4,0,0,I told you to wear the navy, I can only do so much.
4,0,0,As your attorney, I think it's in your best interest to accept the plea deal offering you life.
3,1,0,I think you're possibly looking at life.
3,1,0,When you take the stand next time, stop trying to be funny.
4,0,0,I don't know who to bill !
4,0,0,We've got to claim something besides mistaken identity
2,2,0,Before we begin I need to know - did you do it?
2,1,0,No, we're not at the penalty phase of the trail yet!
4,0,0,The case is looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,This is not a good time.
2,2,0,Let me get this right. You want a stay of execution?
3,0,0,This isn't about saving face.
4,0,0,There's a reason that this is a hoodie-free zone Tyrone.
3,1,0,We will show the court you could not possibly have taken it with you.
2,1,0,I can try arguing self defense.
4,0,0,I can't ask for Death Penalty...I am your Public Defender not he Prosecutor.
4,0,0,What do you think my odds are?
3,1,0,The hood's ok, but you'll have to take the sunglasses off.
4,0,0,Which circle are we in?
4,0,0,So we're going to challenge eyewitness identification?
2,2,0,You're looking at life, would you settle for that?
4,0,0,Can you come back tomorrow, after closing arguments?
4,0,0,Okay fair, he did say a commuted life sentence, but...
3,1,0,Now try to look cheerful.
3,0,1,Try not to make eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,If there's no obit, they must acquit?
3,1,0,Big Pharma wants an injunction against you. It's good for shareholders.
1,2,0,What have you got to lose? Go for the death penalty.
4,0,0,The selfies are a real problem for us.
2,2,0,They can't implement the death penalty unless you commit suicide.
3,1,0,We're not playing chess. This is a court room.
4,0,0,Hoodies are not allowed in the courtroom
2,2,0,You really killed them in your cross-examination
4,0,0,Are you sure you don't want to plead and get life?
4,0,0,The prosecution will try to get you to grin. Don't.
1,2,0,I don't think 'it's inevitable' is a winning defense.
4,0,0,Try to lose the smirk, will you?
4,0,0,So, you are saying that a Hung Jury is my only chance? - I think I can take care of that.
3,0,1,When I said dress for court, I just assumed you understood that meant lose the hoodie.
2,0,2,Tell the truth, you were just doing your job.
4,0,0,I don't recommend you take the stand.
4,0,0,Hey, you're early and as you can see, we're just getting started here. You must have caught the red eye in from Huntsville this morning.
2,0,1,I thought you said Christmas Past could give you an alibi
4,0,0,I don't think they'll seek the death penalty. Too ironic.
4,0,0,Sir, you'll need to relax. He hasn't gotten the death penalty yet.
4,0,0,Objection!
4,0,0,That's not what a life sentence means.
2,1,1,Let's go with the hoodie on.
3,0,0,They want you to try on the hat.
3,0,0,We need to concentrate on your case. You can't keep living in the past.
3,1,0,If you didn't kill him then who did?
4,0,0,You said you could get me out of this!" "Not exactly the way you expect...
3,1,0,You need to know that the others find you somewhat standoffish
4,0,0,Fortunately, the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,1,They want you to take off your hoodie
3,0,0,Don't worry, I've defended much worse
3,0,0,The defense: "Till Death Do Us Part" won't get you far.
4,0,0,Don't worry. The bailiff won't let anything happen to your scythe.
3,0,0,A hoodie in the courtroom? Are you trying to get yourself killed?
3,0,1,You're lucky our firm does pro bono work.
2,1,0,There is a real possibility you could get the live penalty.
2,1,0,You had better leave the jury challenges to me in the future.
4,0,0,So, are you saying you're NOT a hood?
3,1,0,Let me get this right....you WANT the death penalty?
4,0,0,it's because everyone does agree that you 'just kill' in that hoodie
3,0,0,You're asking for it.
4,0,0,I don't really like 'Devil's Advocate.' I'm rebranding as 'Mordor's Helper.'
2,1,1,Do you have any cloaks in soothing pastels?
3,0,1,I can get you immunity, but only if you testify against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
3,0,0,Don't answer that, you risk life!
3,0,1,Remember, all we have to prove is reasonable doubt
2,1,0,Be charming when you take the stand. Just say your name is "Reaper" and drop the "Grim".
4,0,0,The judge feels very very strongly for the death sentence on this case.
1,3,0,We just need to stick to the story, ‘He was already dead when you got there.’
3,1,0,This trial has become a real face-off.
2,1,1,They got you for tax evasion. You know the saying: you and taxes.
4,0,0,When you take the stand, try not to look so grim.
2,1,0,This is not what I expected when I asked you to wear a business suit.
4,0,0,Just tell them you lost your head.
3,1,0,The prosecution rests in peace.
1,1,0,Well what penalty did you expect to get?
3,1,0,My advise is that you present "closing argument"
2,1,0,I don't think a jury trial is the best idea.
4,0,0,Apparently everyone in this class action is dead.
2,1,0,no. I said death and taxes. Not death and illegal offshore tax shelters.
3,1,0,My objection was overruled. Your turn.
2,1,1,If we plea, I can get you life.
3,1,0,You probably shouldn't have worn the hoodie today.
2,1,1,We'll just lie; who cares if you get the death penalty?
1,3,0,Just don't mention what you do for a living and you'll be fine.
4,0,0,Judge Harry ordered you to leave your scythe outside the courtroom?
4,0,0,The outfit's not helping, OJ
3,1,0,I suggest we go with the 'act of God' defence.
4,0,0,Ix-nay on wearing the hoodie to court.
3,0,0,you know that death and hoodies just dont mix.
3,0,0,Take it easy. We have a good I.D. defense.
2,1,0,Listen Pal, I'm telling you the Ghost of Christmas Past would work better for this case.
4,0,0,You are not really needed here. This is traffic court.
3,1,0,The judge thinks he saw you in a Bergman movie. Yes or no.
3,0,0,Mr. Kaczynski, did the lean-to have a mailbox?
3,1,0,"So what you're saying is, if we win this case, you and I are good". If we lose, I can expect to see you much sooner than later".
4,0,0,We might have trouble finding sympathetic jurors.
3,1,0,We need to change your image. You look like death warmed over.
3,0,1,Both you and your chances in this case are really grim.
2,1,0,You shouldn't get life.
4,0,0,I think your 'hoodie' is spooking the jury.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I don't think that shouting 'I'm coming for you next!" is the best way to deal with these serious allegations.
4,0,0,In spite of the preponderance of evidence, I think you are coming off really well.
4,0,0,I told you to bring you head to court!
3,0,1,We'll plea-bargain for death.
2,1,1,As your attorney I have to advise you against telling each member of the court the date of their demise.
2,0,1,Was a suit and tie too much to ask?
3,1,0,I'm gonna recommend the death penalty.
2,2,0,When the DA asks you your occupation, say you work for a collection agency.
4,0,0,Yes I know, but also unavoidable are your taxes.
4,0,0,It's a deposition...not an inquisition
4,0,0,You death, me taxes. Together we'd be unstoppable.
2,1,0,You won't have a chance if you sit thru the trial just looking so guilty.
4,0,0,Sorry, but I usually don't recommend the death penalty for petty theft.
3,1,0,They threw out 106 billion of the counts against you based on the statute of limitations, but that still leaves 1 billion.
4,0,0,I plead guilty to life after life.
4,0,0,Look Mr. Reaper, we can't just keep using the old "it's my job" defense...
4,0,0,I swear I have New York values and I didn't vote for Cruze
2,1,0,It didn't work for Lt. Calley.
3,0,1,We're going to claim that Obamacare is an undue burden on your livelihood.
4,0,0,And don't bring up 'death panels' again.
4,0,0,What. What? You planted the key in Steven Avery's trailer?
3,1,0,I hear that you're the master of jury tampering.
2,1,1,I need you to stop saying, 'It was his time.' Try 'I don't recall,' instead.
2,2,0,It's looking . . . well . . . grim.
3,1,0,Good news. It's a hung jury.
4,0,0,Just so you know, the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,Your situation looks grim but I'm guessing you're used to it.
3,0,0,Next the prosecution is going to ask about discovery.
3,1,0,This case might last an eternity.
4,0,0,Look, it's a no win situation here. She picked you out of a lineup. Plead guilty or go to trial....either way, we're all dead!
3,1,0,Jack the Ripper is not the sort of character witness I had in mind.
4,0,0,Don't worry. Everyone knows you are certain.
3,0,1,C'mon man, you know I can't allow you to shake hands with the Prosecution.
4,0,0,Let's go over your testimony. The last time you saw her she was still alive...
4,0,0,They won't seek the death penalty, they can't promote suicide.
2,2,0,Mr. Reaper, as your counsel, I am advising to stop claiming that you oversee all "encryptions".
3,1,0,Our strategy is simple-- go for the death penalty.
2,0,2,I'm sorry, but there's been a grave misunderstanding - a unanimous vote for death means you did NOT win.
2,2,0,Actually, it doesn't matter if you are death destroyer of worlds - she still gets the house
2,2,0,Their facial-recognition evidence is pretty thin.
3,1,0,I guess if all else fails we can try the no face defense.
2,1,0,It means that your request to be appointed legal guardian has been denied.
3,0,0,From now on you tell me everything!
4,0,0,I am confident they wont sentence you to yourself.
4,0,0,Plead insanity.
4,0,0,So...the proverbial empty suit is now the empty hoodie?
4,0,0,I am sorry it took so long to get a court date
1,2,0,I think I can get this judge to give you life.
3,0,1,I thought you said you were deaf.
4,0,0,I hear the jury is considering a life sentence...
4,0,0,Look, if you just leave, I'll cut you in for half of my contingent fee.
3,1,0,We discussed this. You're not testifying.
2,1,0,Take my wife - please.
3,1,0,I knew the public defender would be the death of me.
4,0,0,Let's hope for the Death Penalty!
2,2,0,We'll plead mitigating circumstances - you were just doing your job...
4,0,0,Yes I think we both agree the Death penalty is discriminatory in your case.
4,0,0,I think we have a solid case for a decision to award royalties from The New Yorker.
4,0,0,Now you show me the smoking gun? You're killin' me here.
4,0,0,But it just isn't happening at the other campaign rallies.
1,1,0,It's immaterial to try to get life.
3,0,0,It's a simple trial. The jerks at the New Yorker Cartoon contest promised they wouldn't e-mail advertising to you, and then they did.
3,1,0,We really need to change your image.
3,0,0,Somehow, your hoodie doesn't read "Jeff Zuckerberg" to this jury, Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,I'd say our chances of an acquittal are looking Grim.
2,1,1,When you get on the stand, try looking a little less grim.
4,0,0,And remember - hesitating during cross examination is the kiss of death.
3,0,0,He said rise, not scythe.
4,0,0,I recommend you plead no-contest to the tax-evasion charge.
3,1,0,I say we go for the death penalty.
4,0,0,How did you manage not to escape detection?
2,2,0,Okay - it looks like we're stuck with the reaping, but could you be a little less grim?
4,0,0,I don't think I can get you off. But we can avoid the death penalty.
3,1,0,I wish you had told me you dumped the scythe in the river.
3,1,0,I think juror number ten likes you.
3,0,1,No, you can't strike all the jurors.
4,0,0,We cop a plea, I'll get you life.
4,0,0,All I asked was that you wear the button down I got you.
4,0,0,Public defenders can't afford to dress you for court.
3,0,1,If you cooperate, they'll take you off the table.
2,0,2,Sorry, "It was their time" is not a valid defense.
3,1,0,You're certain you wanted a Tax attorney?
1,3,0,Here's the offer - you plead to one count of murder, and no contest to the other 6,999,999,999 counts.
4,0,0,I think we'd have better luck if you lost the hoodie.
4,0,0,But, sorry, a zip code is required.
4,0,0,I know you're "just not another pretty face" but prove it to the jury...
4,0,0,I get it, but I'm on track for partner.
2,1,0,Your case looks grim, Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,I'm working to get the "your" penalty off the table".
4,0,0,Fortunately, they weren't able to lift any fingerprints off the scythe.
4,0,0,community service is what the charge is.
3,1,0,But she is allowing the hoodie due to your special circumstances.
4,0,0,What evidence, Mr. Death? Just a big sharp sickle found near the body!
2,2,0,You didn't tell me about your record.
4,0,0,Remember what I told you. When you take the stand, it's all about eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,Just remember -- we have science behind us.
3,1,0,They found your DNA on the scythe.
4,0,0,Gasp! The hood fits.
4,0,0,The prosecution says you should be on their table.
4,0,0,It's a parking ticket. You can't ask for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Do you really think it's going that bad?
2,0,2,The outcome looks grim.
4,0,0,Are you sure you've told me everything...?
2,2,0,You really need to stop giggling every time the prosecutor mentions the death penalty.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper. This is a court room. Yes, justice and truth were the first victims. However, threatening the judge with the fires from hell and eternal damnation will not help your case.
3,0,0,Don't worry. Their case relies on face recognition software.
3,1,0,Nothing personal, but I prefer a different court appointed attorney.
3,0,0,When you testify be sure to face the jurors.
2,1,1,They're offering you the death penalty. I recommend you take it.
4,0,0,Remember: The Devil Made You Do It.
2,1,0,It seems that all their witnesses are missing. Do you know anything about this?
2,0,1,No, I don't want you to get your sickle.
3,0,0,“I say we plea bargin for the death penalty." - the Grim Reaper is actually the lawyer (my fave) or the other guy could be the lawyer (it's a two-for!).
4,0,0,I'd like to ask for a continuance.
4,0,0,You're scaring the hell out of the jury.
3,0,0,– hey Death, think we gonna win – why? – they can't find your fingerprints
3,1,0,My advice? Lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,Did you wear a disguised facemask during the robbery?
4,0,0,I'm afraid you're sentenced to life. But it is without hope
4,0,0,No, the death penalty is not an option in this state.
4,0,0,I don't care what you saw on Law and Order -- they're just not going to take a manslaughter plea.
2,2,0,I stronly suggest losing the hoodie, Mr. Reaper.
2,1,0,I'm afraid you are looking at life.
4,0,0,I'm willing to try a plea bargain of life in prison, but I don't think the judge will buy it.
3,1,0,Perhaps it would help if you remove your hoodie.
3,0,0,Tell me again what happened to your first two attorneys?
1,2,0,Are you sure nobody saw your face?
4,0,0,Mr. Crane, at some point you have to face the facts.
4,0,0,Knight to queen's bishop 3.
3,1,0,Take care of jurors 3, 5, and 8 and we're home free.
3,1,0,You really are the client from hell
3,1,0,You've gotta stop staring through the jurors.
4,0,0,Don't worry. Reaping is totally legal.
2,2,0,Relax. The onus is on the Crown to prove that scythe was intended for anything but trimming the lawn....
3,0,0,We just handle your trusts and estates.
4,0,0,You're missing all of your 1099-DIE forms.
3,1,0,Personally, I like the hoody but it doesn't represent the 'nice guy' image we need you to have. Also, I think your name could be a problem for some of the jurors.
3,0,0,God made me do it - a bit hokey but does rhyme with acquit.
4,0,0,No, Kafkaesque trial isn't a good enough reason to plead fifth.
4,0,0,I'm your perfect lawyer, I've got no soul.
3,1,0,I told you that trip to Cabo would come back to haunt you.
3,0,1,Lets' not mention your "profession."
4,0,0,Trust me on this, we want a hung not a hanged jury.
3,1,0,They're want to charge you with murder, but I think we can get it down to manslaughter.
3,1,0,It's a wrongful death suit.
3,0,1,We've got to make reaping look cool.
3,1,0,I'll try, but I can't promise you the death penalty.
4,0,0,It's looking pretty grim.
1,3,0,You know on the stand, you'll have to bare your soul
4,0,0,Grin what?
3,0,0,Now, go explain your innocence-- with feeling.
3,1,0,Yes, you do have to pay your death taxes.
4,0,0,For contest of April 4, 2016: "Someone's going to be one brick short of a load."
4,0,0,I'm not the one on trial here you know. I don't appreciate your attitude.
4,0,0,I told you to appear grim, not like the grim reaper.
4,0,0,Piece of cake. My firm represented Ted Kennedy.
3,1,0,I'll be honest, I'm not certain this judge will favor you over taxes.
1,0,2,Mint?
2,2,0,A lot of people are dying to see how this case turns out.
4,0,0,You look like a 'New Yorker Cartoon'
3,0,0,We'll win if you can scare the piss out of the jury.
4,0,0,Don't let on that you've worked with this judge in the past.
3,1,0,They can't acquit, the hood actually fits
2,1,1,Have you signed a book deal yet?
4,0,0,What game of chess?
1,2,0,Don't keep looking at the jurors. It's not helping your case.
3,0,0,You have no standing in a right to life case.
4,0,0,I'm hoping they'll declare a mythtrial.
2,1,0,I'm thinking that taking the stand in your own defense may not be our best strategy.
4,0,0,How indispensable is the black cloak?
3,0,1,Don't worry. You won't get life.
3,0,1,Yes, I know, you already are dead man walking.
3,1,0,I don't think it sat well with the jury when you said your hobbies were spontaneous combustion and Ebola.
0,2,2,I'm a lawyer...I sold my soul a long time ago.
3,0,1,Any plea deal is unlikely -- in your case, EVERYONE wants to shoot the messenger
4,0,0,Do I look nervous now
2,1,0,The judge says metaphysical flights aren't deductible unless your Boss signs off on them.
3,0,0,Now you'll have to show a face to the case.
3,1,0,So, am I defending you as the Grim Reaper or the Grim Rapper?
3,1,0,Didn't I tell you to wear the navy blue cardigan?
4,0,0,Remember: if the hood don't fit they must acquit.
1,3,0,I told you to lose the 'hoodie', and wear a suit.
4,0,0,Are you there ?
3,1,0,Oh boy... You say you know the judges daughter how?
3,0,1,Wear a suit next time.
4,0,0,Remember, if we win, no high fives. Paralegals don't grow on trees.
4,0,0,I think I can get the death penalty off the table!
2,1,1,Now would be a good time to show a little emotion.
3,1,0,Yes,I think first impressions are pretty damn important.
4,0,0,Credibility..may be an issue.
4,0,0,There's no way the jury will vote not guilty. I suggest a plea bargain.
3,1,0,Denial, is first.
3,1,0,Let's go over this again; Your defense is "mortality"?
4,0,0,I'm sorry, I did my best, but it looks like life.
4,0,0,Are you sure you're not keeping anything from me, Mr. Spectre? It could affect the outcome of our case.
3,0,0,You're my legal aid attorney?
4,0,0,Death row? Well, that shortens my commute.
3,0,0,You got this. They're all afraid of you. Everybody in the room is afraid of you.
3,1,0,None of the plaintiffs will be testifying.
4,0,0,Juries respond much better to business casual.
3,0,1,Just keep a blank face.
4,0,0,You're the reason blind submissions don't work.
3,0,1,Are you sure the judge will be lenient because you're related?
2,2,0,Jury No. 3 has the same outfit!
4,0,0,There's justice then there's blind justice!
3,0,1,Death....you need to take the stand....You are facing life.
3,1,0,I'm quite sure you'll get life.
4,0,0,Plead guilty and they'll put the death penalty back on the table,
3,0,1,I'm not sure calling Pestilence, War and Famine as character witnesses was the best idea.
4,0,0,Try to look conflicted, it will work better with the jury.
3,1,0,Tell me was it the Salmon Paté at lunch?
4,0,0,I recommend we settle.
2,2,0,No, I don't think self-defense will work in this case
2,2,0,No - Death and Taxes, not Death or Taxes.
2,2,0,How does life without parole sound to YOU?
4,0,0,I'd take the plea, the murder weapon was a scythe.
4,0,0,I was able to get you off with the Death Penalty
4,0,0,Relax. This isn't my first wrongful death case.
3,1,0,This is traffic court, Tax court is next door in courtroom C
3,1,0,It's not the first count that I'm worried about, it's the next 11 billion that concern me.
2,1,0,The prosecution is talking death penalty.
4,0,0,Look, the evidence clearly states that you bargained for a one way ticket, not round trip.
4,0,0,They're asking for twenty years. I'll try and get death.
4,0,0,The jury was unsympathetic to your testimony of 'sucking air from their souls'
2,0,0,The whistleblower defense might have worked...but that was before you went and killed Scalia.
3,1,0,I don't think "when your time's up, your time's up" satisfied the jury.
3,1,0,I suggest an Alford plea.
3,1,0,They're asking for a continuance. What do you think?
1,2,0,Don't worry. I'll kill him on the cross-exam.
4,0,0,Everybody knows you were supposed to knock first!
2,2,0,I have no objection to the death penalty.
3,1,0,What do you mean, your mind has gone blank?
3,1,0,"I'm trying to make sure there are no widows on the jury".
3,1,0,I know, I know, he was already dead when you got there.
4,0,0,Looks like you're missing your tee time, the judge is keeping the death penalty on the table.
3,0,1,No pun intended, but our chances look grim.
2,2,0,I think I can get you life. Will that be weird?
2,1,1,Don't worry - 'until death do you part' is now negotiable.
4,0,0,You understand that I'll get 50 percent and that you can't take your share with you.
4,0,0,I know what you think, but I'm taking the plea.
4,0,0,''I specifically said 'suit,' not 'professionally.' ''
4,0,0,Your outfit may be de rigueur but I think it's suggestive of the death penalty.
3,1,0,You asked for me?
4,0,0,Trying to save face for a faceless crime won't cut it with the jury.
4,0,0,All we have to do is raise reasonable doubt.
3,1,0,"Et in arcadia ego" is not a great alibi.
4,0,0,Let's make sure I understand. You want the death penalty.
3,0,1,The courtroom artist's going to struggle with you.
2,0,2,Don't worry. Taxes has agreed to testify.
2,0,2,What part of "Lose the hoodie" did you not understand?
3,1,0,The judge may ask you to take your hood off, but don't.
3,0,0,You mean everyone at your law firm wears hoods?
4,0,0,You do know that petty theft is not a capital offense?
4,0,0,Frankly,the gangsta hoodie routine isn't helping your image.
2,2,0,The bad news is they have a lot of witnesses against you - the good news is none of them are available to testify.
3,1,0,You're not afraid of the death penalty, are you?
2,2,0,You just killed your chance for an acquittal.
4,0,0,No, in this court the judge and jury are separate.
3,0,0,They're asking for life, which I'm going to argue in your case is irrelevant.
3,1,0,They found the scythe, but there weren't any prints.
4,0,0,I really didn't think I was doing that badly.
4,0,0,Relax...all the witnesses are dead.
3,1,0,How many billable hours do I have left?
3,1,0,Due to your inability to pay, you're better off pleading guilty to the theft of 100 billion souls.
2,1,0,The prosecutor's asking for life.
3,0,1,Remember, you were just harvesting grain.
4,0,0,You're accused of ghosting on your wife
3,0,1,OK, OK, we'll try for 'manslaughter'
3,0,1,I think keeping the scythe out of sight would be a very good idea.
3,1,0,Well, it is a matter of life and death, but...you already know that.
3,0,0,No, do not show them your scythe!
4,0,0,Your case isn't looking good but I don't think you have much to lose.
4,0,0,Did you have to wear the same hooded sweatshirt?
4,0,0,Remember, no jury tampering.
3,1,0,Cheer up, you could get life.
2,2,0,Don't worry, we'll put forward a spirited defense.
4,0,0,Should I plead "not guilty"?
1,1,2,You look like death.
2,1,1,Just so we're clear — in this room, you leave the soul-sucking to me.
4,0,0,I know you feel cheated, but this is a good deal.
2,2,0,It'd look better if you had a living alibi.
3,1,0,If we get an acquittal, you will have cheated, well, yourself.
3,0,0,I'm hoping for a hung jury
3,0,0,It's the worst possible verdict. They gave you life.
4,0,0,I told you not to wear black. It makes the jury think you're evil.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, looks like it's going to be the life penalty...
3,0,0,don't worry, we are going to appeal your live penalty sentence
3,1,0,What the hell. Plead guilty.
3,1,0,"Reaping what you sow" is not a good defense.
4,0,0,... would a change of clothing have really killed you?
3,1,0,Tell me you're not thinking of jury tampering.
3,1,0,I don't believe you're going to incur much sympathy from this jury.
4,0,0,Would you like a mint?
3,1,0,THIS WILL BE A WIN FOR OUR SIDE, NOBODY RECOGNIZED YOU AT THE LINE UP.
4,0,0,If you get the death penalty, don't laugh.
4,0,0,We're down to 7 million first degrees and 3 counts of manslaughter.
2,2,0,Why yes, I do see you getting life without parole as being rather ironic
3,0,0,You should have appealed earlier.
3,0,0,Change of venue? To where?
4,0,0,Unfortunately the beer recipe must be licensed from the monastery for lawful reproduction
4,0,0,It looks like we have a hung jury.
3,1,0,Calling yourself Dr. Death is not helping.
3,0,1,I think you're beyond double jeopardy.
4,0,0,I don't think the second amendment covers your scythe
4,0,0,Do you have a blue suit?
4,0,0,They’re just prejudiced. They think that every faceless man in a cloak is guilty of soul theft.
2,0,1,It's best if you remain silent about your occupation.
3,1,0,I'm afraid the sentence is death.
3,1,0,Acquittal shouldn't be a problem...after all, this is a 'no death penalty' state.
3,1,0,This is traffic court. I can't ask the judge to give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,To tell you the truth, you've got bupkis.
4,0,0,THE JUDGE WILL GIVE YOU PROBATION IF HE CAN HAVE YOUR HOODIE.
2,0,2,Yes, your jury will be out for an eternity.
3,0,0,Your hood not fitting is a valiant, but poor, attempt at an aquittal.
4,0,0,How's that whole grim reaper thing working for you now?
3,1,0,Remember to say, you 'kindly' stopped for him.
4,0,0,With any luck the prosecutor will ask for life.
4,0,0,Our basic defense is, it was too dark to see a damn thing.
4,0,0,You shouldn't have used facebook to announce your arrival
3,1,0,Whatever you do, don't use the "d" word.
4,0,0,It's gonna be hard to beat this murder rap.
4,0,0,Where did you say you were from?
2,2,0,You're in luck, they're seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,No! We're petitioning for sole custody, not soul custody!
4,0,0,As your legal counsel, I suggest you stop saying 'The GR is in the House'.
2,2,0,Ditching the scythe was a good first step. Now about the hoodie...
1,2,1,Next time you identify someone, don't point, just nod your head
4,0,0,I'm pretty certain we'll beat the murder charge, but there's no escaping the back taxes
2,1,1,Saying "Go to Hell" is not interpreted here as "Go home."
4,0,0,You of all people should know a continuance is out of the question.
4,0,0,Quit making eye contact with juror #3.
3,0,0,You mean you are not Mark Zuckerberg?
4,0,0,Of course we could file a cease and desist order. or They served us with a cease and desist order.
3,0,0,If you wanted Clarence Darrow, you should have thoght of that earlier.
2,0,1,Apparently Ingmar Bergman's motion is still under court review.....
2,1,1,Would it kill you to wear a suit and tie?
4,0,0,I want to make death great again.
4,0,0,Don't let them intimidate you!
3,0,1,Apparently, in this country, taxes are more certain than death.
3,0,1,So what makes you think you were profiled?
4,0,0,Grim Reaper won't play well with the jury. Lets emphasize the "Angel" in Angel of Death.
4,0,0,Looks like the death penalty is back on the table.
3,1,0,I still think a jacket and tie might help your defense
4,0,0,Believe me, mistaken identity is our only defense.
3,1,0,Let's not mention your regular job.
4,0,0,Please Death, remember to shave next time
3,0,1,I don't think calling Satan as a character witness was such a good idea.
3,1,0,Even if we don't win, we've got a great shot at a miniseries.
3,1,0,Does that hoodie come in blue?
4,0,0,No! No! No! You are NOT starting with the same fan base as OJ!
3,0,1,I'd prefer a life sentence.
2,1,1,It's working. You're scaring the jury.
4,0,0,What do you mean you don't think your ready
4,0,0,They're seeking the undeath penalty, but you can always appeal your resurrection.
4,0,0,Tax evasion, huh?
3,0,1,In your case, the death penalty might be preferable to jail time.
3,1,0,Mr. Reaper, didn't I suggest a wardrobe change for court?
3,1,0,Sooo...... how do you feel about lawyers?
3,1,0,Request a death sentence?Clever.
4,0,0,Why did you bury the scythe in OJ's backyard?
3,1,0,Could you maybe lose the hoodie?
2,2,0,I can promise you one thing, you won't get life.
3,0,0,Usually I advise against plea bargaining for the death penalty for a parking violation.
3,1,0,If you don't take the plea deal, the prosecutor's going to seek the life penalty.
3,0,0,Santa Claus I could get off. You, not so much.
4,0,0,I've got some bad news, Mr Reaper. They've taken the death penalty off the table.
1,2,0,The outlook of your case is very grim.
2,0,1,We need the jury to see you as a cheerful Reaper.
4,0,0,Insider training IS a faceless crime.
4,0,0,If you are not that street artist, take off that hood and prove it.
3,0,1,We're pushing for death with parole, but it doesn't look promising.
4,0,0,Don't worry, if you've killed as many people as you say then death row is a cinch.
3,1,0,We can get you off the pestilence charge on a technicality
2,0,1,I'd advise you to lose the hoodie before the jury is seated.
3,0,0,You can probably avoid the death penalty, but you'll have to plead insanity.
4,0,0,This above all: to thine own self be true.
4,0,0,Yes, everybody knows death is certain. But so are taxes, and that's why we're here.
3,1,0,They'll let you walk if you testify against the other horsemen.
4,0,0,It's not likely anyone will recognize you.
1,1,2,Stop telling the jurors you can't wait to meet them.
3,1,0,Eventually they will be a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,I'm dying to hear the verdict too
3,1,0,When we reconvene, be sure to bring the ill-filling glove.
2,1,1,I can't emphasize this enough: Eye Contact
4,0,0,No, I don't think the judge will settle this with a game of chess.
4,0,0,Stop pointing at the jury and telling them that one day you will be coming for them.
2,1,1,I know it's just a parking ticket, but you're still looking at manslaughter.
4,0,0,They call you, Robin Hoodie.
2,1,1,So...What do you want to do for lunch?
4,0,0,That would be a *hanged* jury.
2,2,0,The case is circumstantial at best. No one ever saw your face.
3,1,0,Don't forget to make eye contact.
2,1,0,Let's face it, you can't win this one.
3,1,0,Remember, don't approach the bench.
2,1,1,I told you to ditch the hoodie. It scares people.
3,0,1,ALL of them?
3,0,0,This is a deadly case
4,0,0,What do you mean, you want the death penalty? ("Want" should be ital.)
3,0,1,You'd have had more luck if you'd gone with the plaid shirt and sport coat like I said.
3,1,0,You're not helping!
3,1,0,What do you mean you didn't bring the scythe?! Great, the prosecution is just going to kill you up there.
3,0,1,Just don't point at the judge.
3,1,0,The good news is that they won't ask for life.
2,2,0,They ran face-recognition software on the surveillance footage, and for you it's looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I would advise against you taking the stand in your own defense.
3,1,0,Can you arrange a hanged jury?
2,1,0,I'll get the IRS off your back if you get off mine
4,0,0,Racketeering? Are you kidding me?
4,0,0,I know the death penalty thing appeals to you but this is only a minor traffic violation
4,0,0,Your chances are looking grim, Grim.
3,1,0,Since the prosecution's case is based largely on facial recognition, you should walk.
4,0,0,I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you don't look like a public defender.
3,0,0,When the prosecution says it "rests," stop saying "in peace" afterwards.
4,0,0,Let's call you The Angel of Involuntary Manslaughter.
4,0,0,I don't think "If the hood don't fit we must acquit" defense will work here.
3,0,1,Don't worry - in this state, there's no death penalty.
3,1,0,Your best shot is to roll with the Michael Jordan meme.
3,0,1,try to look on the bright side
4,0,0,You're going to have to face this.
2,2,0,No- I decide which jurors to eliminate
3,1,0,How long does that starching hold up?
3,1,0,Let's face it... Anything you get is a death penalty.
3,1,0,OK, no nicknames. Your name is GILBERT Reaper....
3,1,0,At least they cannot give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Array suit with a blue tie might have been better
3,1,0,Yes, Mr. Gupta should not have entitled his book "Cheating Death.'
4,0,0,Hoodie, smoodie--you'll still do 18 long ones.
3,0,0,So, let's assume the death penalty is off the table...
4,0,0,Sorry, but there's no statute of limitations on murder.
3,1,0,With all this evidence, your chances are looking Grim.
0,1,3,Jury of your peers? Ah... I don't think so.
4,0,0,Take it off before you take the stand unless you want the jury to think you're a thug or a jihadist.
3,1,0,Looks like you're going to get "life".
4,0,0,I'm sorry, there is no death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,Not good, but what do you have to lose?
2,1,1,They're trying to decide if Habeas No Corpus counts.
3,1,0,Remember, I asked you to wear a suit to make a good impression.
4,0,0,I really don't think the chair is such a bad result.
2,2,0,I'm going to push the rationale that a death sentence would be superfluous.
4,0,0,We have a good judge. The tax collector just got off.
3,1,0,A death sentence would be ironic.
2,2,0,So the plea is, you go free and everyone lives, right?
4,0,0,If you want a shot at winning this, you really should consider getting a new suit.
4,0,0,We're lucky. This judge is rather lenient with tax evasion cases.
3,1,0,Be yourself with the Jury, or else they'll see right through you.
3,0,0,You have no witnesses. No one has ever come back from the dead.
3,1,0,But I wasn't wearing a disguise.
2,1,1,I don't think they'll go for involuntary manslaughter.
4,0,0,You're sure you want me to go ahead with that "chess defense" ?
3,1,0,If you want to appeal, I need another 100 souls as a retainer.
1,2,1,They say your DNA is on the sickle.
2,0,2,Jury selection is not going well.
4,0,0,Given your history, citing diminished responsibility might not be the best way forward.
4,0,0,What are your credentials for being a death penalty expert?
4,0,0,Yes, it would appear that there is a third certainty when you wear a hoodie on the streets of America
4,0,0,I have to say- I know you said you were a CIA spook, but this is still a little startling.
3,1,0,I'll handle the witness; you handle the judge.
4,0,0,It would help your case if you could ditch that hoodie.
3,1,0,The evidence is overwhelming. However, I think I can argue that the search for your scythe was unconstitutional.
3,1,0,Good news. It's only a life sentence.
4,0,0,I thought I asked you to wear a tie...
4,0,0,I'm the lawyer. I make the closing statement.
4,0,0,Goodbye Winston.
4,0,0,OK Grimm, please don't go ruin your defense by saying how soooo pro-death penalty you are.
3,1,0,Yes, I know you are guaranteed a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,Get over it - there's no way to get your scythe through security.
3,1,0,As my client, I have to be honest with you - the death penalty is a distinct possibility.
4,0,0,Remember. You have the right to remain silent.
2,0,2,Bad news--you got the death penalty. Good news--that's a conflict of interest.
3,0,1,Are you sure they didn't get a good look at your face?
4,0,0,I think I can get you off with time served!
3,1,0,It's just that the hood has sort of a connotation.
4,0,0,You are right, it does look grim.
2,1,0,At least you look less menacing to the jury without your scythe.
4,0,0,They've got you at the scene. They've got you on motive. Let's leave the reaper home again tomorrow, OK?
4,0,0,I thought we were clear you'd dress a little less grim.
2,0,1,Didn't I tell you to wear your blue suit and tie to court today?
3,0,0,Trust me, the devil is in the details !
4,0,0,You've been a huge help through this case - I don't consider you a penalty at all.
4,0,0,Try not to sound emotional.
2,1,0,You'll have plenty of time for soul searching.
2,1,1,I hope you didn't have anything to do with the deaths of all the jurors.
4,0,0,Keep a poker face, the jury will be watching.
3,0,1,The verdict could be grim.
3,0,1,You're being sentenced to life.
3,1,0,Try not to have a blank stare when you look at the judge.
0,2,2,No, I don't think carrying out the death penalty will be part of your community service.
3,1,0,The best we'll get is manslaughter.
3,1,0,Again, that's not what we mean by habeas corpus.
4,0,0,As your attorney, I don't recommend requesting death.
3,1,0,When they ask what you do for a living, plead the fifth.
2,1,1,On the positive side, I don't think you'll have to worry about receiving the death penalty.
2,2,0,Do you have any character references who can testify?
3,1,0,Your identity change is perfect. No worries.
3,0,1,I don't think, "I barely touched him" is going to be a strong enough defense.
4,0,0,I don't think that the hood does anything for your case, Jerry.
4,0,0,Did my mother -in -law send you
3,1,0,Their case is pretty circumstantial.
3,1,0,Frankly, we're in trouble. Everyone on the jury is alive.
4,0,0,I just don't think a hoodie conveys the right message.
2,0,1,They want you to serve five to ten, but I think we can get them to agree to the death penalty.
3,0,0,I agree, losing the scythe should help your defense
4,0,0,You think you have everyone fooled but I can see right through you!
3,1,0,Sentencing could be rough - you've got a lot of previous...
4,0,0,They're rejecting our plea for natural life.
3,1,0,This jury will not sympathize with 'a downtrodden black man in white gloves.'
2,2,0,We gotta get you on the stand and erase the jury's preconceived bias.
4,0,0,I probably should have worn a tie.
3,0,0,Don't look directly at the jury, they'll consider it confrontational...
4,0,0,You really need to start giving me a heads up about that kind of stuff.
4,0,0,It's not a big deal if you get the death penalty.
3,1,0,I am advising you to lose the hood.
2,2,0,We can ask for the death penalty but I can promise we'll get it.
1,3,0,I must warn you. Trying to collect on your own life insurance is very tricky.
0,2,0,I think he already holds you in contempt.
3,0,0,I can get you life without parole.
3,1,0,Don't destroy a good story with the truth.
4,0,0,Needs more cowbell.
3,1,0,You seem familiar, but I can't quite place the face.
2,1,1,It would help your case if you were on Facebook.
3,0,0,If asked, say docent. It's less threatening.
2,2,0,I really wish you wouldn't take the phrase "face your accuser" so personally.
4,0,0,Let's just say, where you are going, its going to be very hot.
4,0,0,We'll just tell the jury you're from the hood. It doesn't sound as grim.
3,1,0,You're innocent until proven inevitable.
2,2,0,The outlook is grim.
2,1,1,The caselaw is unsettled as to what a life sentence means in your situation.
4,0,0,Will the unveiling be done at Halloween?
4,0,0,Your smell of death is not good for our case.
4,0,0,You're safe - this state supports the death penalty.
4,0,0,I don't think they'll accept the death penalty as a plea bargain.
1,2,1,I take it you would be okay with the death penalty.
3,1,0,You've been accused of wrongful death. How do you want to plead?
3,1,0,I made a deal with the jury they couldn't refuse.
4,0,0,You need to go now, the Death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,Would you go shake hands with the prosecutor?
4,0,0,We're good to go for now, but later, to save face, you'll have to show yours in order to win this thing.
3,0,0,Seriously, ditch the hoodie for a suit and tie.
2,2,0,I don't think the jury is buying that the scythe belonged to "a friend".
4,0,0,"Just appeal to this judge's soft spot." -Attorney states to reaper.
4,0,0,This really seems like Double Jeopardy.
3,0,0,I don't think parole is an option here, buddy.
2,0,2,So I take it that you knew about the death penalty?
3,0,1,I told you this job was soul-sucking.
3,1,0,The death penalty is not on the table.
4,0,0,You should take the deal
3,1,0,Are you my new public defender?
4,0,0,25 to life seems like a pretty fitting sentence.
3,1,0,When you testify, try not to be so grim.
4,0,0,It could be worse, it could be the death sentence...
2,2,0,I'm pinning our hopes on re-branding.
4,0,0,At least you don't have fingerprints.
2,0,2,You let your ex-wife pick out your clothes for court?
4,0,0,Just promise me that you and your scythe will never again visit me in any way except for legal purposes and I will get you off.
3,1,0,Fortunately, there are no witnesses.
2,0,2,First thing, lose the hoodie.
3,0,0,no, you may not tell the Judge that his time has come.
3,1,0,They didn't find any finger prints. So, the evidence is circumstantial at best.
3,1,0,Sorry, but they don't give the death penalty for failing to return a lawn mower.
3,0,0,You're absolutely certain you want a tax attorney?
3,0,1,File a motion to kill this next witness.
3,1,0,You just got the death penalty but, I'm curious, who's going to take you to the other side?
3,1,0,If you agree never to bother the judge, you’re free to go
3,1,0,Remember to smile at the jury.
3,0,1,We like your positive message about capital punishment; we just don't think you're the right messenger.
2,1,0,I've told you before. Perception is everything.
3,1,0,But the scythe does fit.
4,0,0,Like I always advise TNY Ghost Writers,.......Take the Fifth!
4,0,0,No, the death penalty does not apply to parking violations
3,1,0,Wait, your the Grim Reaper? I'm not sure i'm on the right side of this case anymore!
2,1,0,Don't mention your occupation.
2,1,0,If you take the stand, they'll see right through you.
3,0,1,Ironically, they're giving you life.
4,0,0,THE VERDICT IS "LIFE WITHOUT A HOOD"
2,1,1,Worse case scenario, they give you life.
4,0,0,Just sign on the line and I'm fully insured?
2,2,0,Okay, so remember to smile at the jury
4,0,0,I have a really hard time believing this win is good for me.
2,2,0,Just plead 'Guilty'. It's only the death penalty...
3,1,0,It might help if you didn't say "Yes!" whenever the prosecution recommended the death penalty.
2,2,0,I thought you'd buried the evidence
3,1,0,Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're above the law.
3,0,0,Your creative interpretation of the RICO Act could be much more efficient.
4,0,0,You'd be surprised how few interns choose tax law.
4,0,0,Technically, your execution would be death by suicide.
4,0,0,No, facing the jury is a bad idea.
4,0,0,o.k. - just try to look innocent like we practiced.
3,1,0,I don't care if they do give me the death penalty!
2,1,1,I don't think you should testify
2,1,1,Bad News - they just took the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,I'm afraid you're facing the death penalty.
4,0,0,The prosecution is now claiming your DNA is all over the scythe they found at the scene.
2,1,1,Have one of your friends make a visit to Juror #9
3,0,0,Do I still get paid if you don't get a death sentence?
3,1,0,Permit me to play Devil's advocate.
3,0,0,You were the last ghost to see Scrooge alive, No one's buying that he woke up happy.
4,0,0,So, you give up your Pending Hits list ... in exchange for the death penalty.
4,0,0,When I have you testify, make sure you look the jury in their eyes.
3,1,0,It appears your 1099 neglected to mention all you reaped in 2015.
4,0,0,Unless you're thinking of penalizing yourself, they're bluffing.
2,1,1,Things are looking grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Remember, you only did it to get out of the 'hood.
4,0,0,Just say you killed the slaughterer who slaughtered the ox. They don't care about the kid or the two zuzim.
1,2,1,Perhaps 'The devil made me do it.' is not your best defense.
3,0,0,Me? But I paid for all day parking.
2,1,0,When you raise your right hand, point to the judge and strike him dead.
4,0,0,Hood or handles, your choice.
2,2,0,Thanks for leaving the scythe in the car.
4,0,0,We'll get the trial moved to another planet
3,1,0,Remember, your an actuary, not Death, plays much better with the jury.
3,1,0,I'm here for the hung jury.
3,0,1,I specialize in tax law, but there's a lot of overlap.
4,0,0,In this instance, the death penalty would be considered "cruel and unusual."
2,2,0,You're right. Hung jury.
2,2,0,Look, let's wrap this one up before we discuss volume discounts, okay?
2,1,1,Remember our deal: If I successfully defend you for killing everyone who ever lived, I never see you again.
3,1,0,You have nothing to worry about. They'll never be able to identify you.
3,1,0,Sorry, Death. Looks like you might be facing yourself.
3,1,0,You couldn't have worn a suit? You just look guilty.
3,0,1,The prosecution claims they can connect you to any murder.
3,1,0,Well, at least we don't need to worry about the death sentence....
3,0,1,They're sentencing you to ten years in paradise.
3,1,0,Look. There's no way I'm putting you on the stand. I think your best bet is to stare at juror #3.
3,0,0,I represent the IRS. And you?
2,1,1,The penalty is severe. You could get life.
1,2,1,And please try not to touch the bailiff while you're being sworn in.
2,1,0,So you say that your career interests have led you to seek a spot on death row?
2,2,0,It's obviously a case of mistaken identity.
3,0,1,I told you three times, the DA won't agree to the death penalty.
2,0,2,Why so grim?
3,1,0,How many?
2,2,0,Relax. They couldn't find any DNA on the scythe.
3,1,0,The DA will let you plea bargain for life.
4,0,0,Bad news, the prosecution is asking for a life sentence.
2,1,1,You could have at least worn a tie.
4,0,0,Really? Sure, I'll put you on the stand and you can beg for mercy, what have we got to lose.
4,0,0,How can I explain to the Court that you're from the other side?
3,1,0,Few murder victims are as persistent as you.
2,2,0,If asked, you used the scythe for harvesting wheat.
4,0,0,It's going to be tough to beat 42 billion counts of murder.
4,0,0,You should face the jury before they vote.
4,0,0,They'll offer the death penalty; we'll claim double idemnity.
3,1,0,The court will agree with your privacy concerns.
4,0,0,For the last time, I can't plea loitering up to a capital offense
3,1,0,We all know you did it so don't give me the sad puppy-eye look because it just doesn't work for you.
3,1,0,You of all people should know the death penalty is not negotiable .
3,1,0,Trust me. This is not the end.
1,2,1,Business casual works for most clients, but in your case it might not have been such a good idea.
3,1,0,Sorry, the death penalty is not being considered.
2,1,1,I strongly advise we go for the death penalty.
4,0,0,The judge said 'go to hell' in a nice way
2,1,1,That's not how jury nullification works.
4,0,0,We gotta show that 'Be not proud' is not in the public domain.
4,0,0,....it's not a cold case.
2,1,0,I doubt the jury will accept a defense of "occupational homicide".
3,1,0,Can you show the jury a little remorse?
3,0,0,Yes, they're going to eye roll if you say, 'I'll see you in Hell.'
4,0,0,I don't think anyone gives a damn about identifying my lawyer.
2,2,0,It all depends if Jimmy Hoffa's body is where you say it is
1,2,1,Remember, state your name as Mr. Reaper, not Grim Reaper.
2,2,0,You should be more worried about the tax evasion charge.
3,0,1,Let's just go for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Again - NO - we are not asking for the death penalty!
3,1,0,Why so grim? They gave you life.
3,1,0,Ironically, he's the hanging judge.
2,2,0,Don't give me that blank look.
2,2,0,Worst case scenario eternity without parole.
4,0,0,Wait. You want me to ask FOR the death sentence?
3,1,0,Ironically, you could be sentenced to life without parole.
2,2,0,Though in your case, 'life' might be a good thing.
4,0,0,Your finger prints were all over the scythe, Grim.
4,0,0,Nothing extrajudicial this time, ok?
3,1,0,Don't worry. The death penalty was repealed here years ago.
3,1,0,As you are quite aware, you don't have a chance.
3,0,0,I may have to tell you something GRIM.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, there is still the outstanding issue of your bill.
3,0,0,Your case isn't as grim as it looks.
1,2,1,My guess is you don't want Life without Parole.
3,0,1,Are you sure you aren't hiding anything?
3,0,0,How many times have I told you to lose the hoodie?
2,1,0,A scythe? I thought you said Skype!
3,0,0,It'll be important to establish that you've paid your taxes.
3,1,0,Look, it's not a matter of life and death — is it?
3,0,0,We will bury them.
4,0,0,You HAVE to face it now Sheldon! The judge is giving me that look.
1,1,0,I'm afraid the jury can see right through you.
2,1,0,On the plus side, you can't get life.
4,0,0,Better let me do all the talking
3,0,1,It may be advantageous if you remove the hoodie and stop the moaning sounds, your frightening everyone in the courtroom.
4,0,0,I think we're gonna shoot for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Try and put on a good face regardless of the ruling.
3,0,1,They've offered to take the death penalty off the table.
1,2,0,Good news....death penalty's off the table.
3,0,0,If you'll plead out the scythe charge, I can make the rest of it go away.
2,2,0,What do you mean you can't do life?
4,0,0,I can cut a deal but you will have to testify against Taxes
4,0,0,When I told you to drop the black robe, I didn't mean you should wear polka dots instead.
4,0,0,We had to 'dig' up a jury of your peers...12 cadavers.
3,0,0,So, you actually want me to ask for the death penalty...
3,0,0,Well, we didn't have enough money for Mossack Fonseca, so in your case it actually IS tax fraud.
3,1,0,So , after the Archbishop who did you see?
3,0,0,The jury was only out six minutes.
2,2,0,I'm sorry to say this case is taking a grave turn.
4,0,0,How did the defendant survive? I thought you were flawless.
3,1,0,So, what do I owe you if we win this case?
4,0,0,Sorry, I forgot to tell you h-o-o-d-i-e is spelled g-u-i-l-t-y in here.
1,0,2,Remember, you're just a guy trying to save the world from overpopulation.
3,1,0,Let's hope they can't find the Scythe.
4,0,0,You keep telling me I'm going to lose but I have confidence.
4,0,0,My life is on the line here. Don't you make any self-incriminating statements.
2,2,0,No. I deliver the closing statement.
3,1,0,You look surprised..
3,1,0,I'm not sure that a plea of "not guilty" is your best bet.
4,0,0,Your closing argument had a hollow ring to it.
4,0,0,Would you prefer I go for the death penalty?
3,1,0,So much for that Witness Protection Program, huh?
4,0,0,Looks like your only chance is a hung jury.
4,0,0,"It's what I do" is not going to cut it as a defence.
4,0,0,Don't worry, Mr. Death-Rabinowitz. Spousal privilege applies to gay marriages, too, so you won't even have to testify.
3,0,0,I'm afraid I have bad news. They have notified the judge they will be seeking the life sentence.
3,0,1,Don't take the stand in your own defense.
4,0,0,In your case, you'll receive the life penalty.
4,0,0,This case will be the death of me.
4,0,0,Why are you telling me this?
4,0,0,Please don't take this the wrong way, but I feel that your representation in my death penalty case is not in my best interest. I am going to ask for a new lawyer.
4,0,0,Now, don't do anything stupid.
1,1,0,No, I don't think asking for life in prison will get you off the hook.
3,1,0,It would have helped if you hadn't shown up looking like death warmed over.
1,2,1,So, do you have any priors?
4,0,0,Life without parole seems more humane.
4,0,0,We're going to hold out for twelve jurors who were born again.
2,1,1,I say we go for heaven
2,1,0,The prosecution is going for eternal damnation but I'll plead it down to being a super delegate at the Republican convention.
3,0,1,So your saying they got the wrong guy? Your Jim Reaper?
3,1,0,Would it kill you to blink once in a while?
3,1,0,We're going with a Lawful Capacity of Office defense, you were just doing your job
3,0,0,Remember, if anyone asks, it's not your scythe...
3,1,0,At this point the pale horse wouldn't hurt your case.
3,0,0,I'm fighting for your life here!
3,1,0,Bad day to lose your hairdryer.
4,0,0,I think they're going for the death penalty.
1,1,1,My fee is 100 an hour and I don't see you any time soon.
4,0,0,So we really need to establish ownership of the pale horse
1,3,0,What do you mean, you're looking forward to the penalty phase?
3,0,1,I am sorry but the "death penalty" isn't legal in this state.
3,1,0,Do you really think I'm worried about the death sentence?
3,1,0,Now remember Mr. DEATH, when you get on the stand, say only that you were following the company guidelines with regard to your job description.
4,0,0,What's the worst you could get - Life?
4,0,0,So getting you a Life sentence would be a good thing.
3,1,0,Fortunately, the state just repealed the eternal life penalty.
3,1,0,Death Penalty or Life-Either way you're out in no time.
4,0,0,Any chance I can get the chair by Friday? I have a date Saturday afternoon...
3,1,0,Let's use the Star Wars defense.
4,0,0,The prosecution is killing me?
2,2,0,Sure, mortality is inevitable, but it's not a defense.
3,0,0,How do you want to plead?
4,0,0,I've been meaning to ask you if you're hoody is by YEEZY?
4,0,0,Fine, pro bono. But for the record, we DO have a soul.
4,0,0,I guess keeping in touch with facetime is out of the question.
3,0,1,There's no way they can prove it's your scythe.
4,0,0,I wouldn't be making any veiled threats.
4,0,0,As my defense attorney, you say the only option for jaywalking is lethal injection or hanging?
3,0,1,The hoodie thing hasn't worked well for my previous clients.
2,1,0,Nobody cares about your puppy!
2,1,1,A writ of Habeas Corpus may be a little insensitive right now.
2,2,0,I said you may take the fifth not Judge Fitch.
2,2,0,I understand you are cold, but, in this case, a sweater would have been a better choice.
3,0,0,Don't be so grim. There were no eyewitnesses!
3,1,0,Lets face it, no pun intended, things look grim Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,It's 107,602,707,791 counts of 1st degree murder.
2,1,0,You appear to be a habitual offender.
4,0,0,Are you sure juror eight was at your funeral?
4,0,0,Death, thou shalt die!
3,0,0,How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
2,2,0,Death penalty? I don't think so.
3,1,0,No, I don't think a demonstration would help your case right now.
3,0,0,Should I bother having my parking validated if we lose?
3,1,0,We will appeal the sentence unless they come back with the death penalty
3,1,0,...and you handle the estate tax questions.
3,0,0,This not going well - the jury thinks you're just an empty suit, er, hoodie.
2,0,0,Do you have to wear a hoodie, Mr. death?
3,1,0,I am sorry, but it is hard to come up with a defense when you are wanted everywhere for manslaughter.
1,2,1,Ummm…that's not exactly what "habeas corpus" means here.
3,1,0,You should have worn a tie.
3,0,1,I'm worried about jurors number 5, 7 and 8. They look quite ill, wouldn't you agree?
4,0,0,Are you sure you're sure?
2,2,0,Well maybe you should have thought of that before you decided to shake hands with my witnesses.
1,3,0,A suit and tie wouldn't kill you.
3,0,1,I think a plea deal is the best bet for you to avoid the life penalty.
2,2,0,I see where you're coming from and I don't like it.
4,0,0," I thought I told you to wear your white colored hoodie to court".
4,0,0,I think we can plead them down to second degree reaping.
3,0,1,I know you feel strongly about the hoody but generally a jury is swayed by some positive eye contact.
4,0,0,No worries, we will pin it on your campaign manager
3,1,0,I know you made a career change, but reaping someone else's crops is still considered theft.
3,1,0,I'll waive my fee, if you give back my soul.
4,0,0,We just keep hammering home that it would be cruel and unusual to sentence you to life.
4,0,0,Not guilty? But you're still wearing the hoodie?!
3,1,0,If all goes well I can get you the death sentence.
4,0,0,Just remember, you might be facing death...but so is the judge when he talks to you...
3,1,0,No, you MAY NOT hold the scythe when you get on the witness stand.
3,0,0,I told you, suit and tie, no hoodies.
4,0,0,Just plead the Sith
2,2,0,These wrongful death cases can be tricky
4,0,0,Bad news, the scythe is exhibit 1
4,0,0,NO, no, my services are free if you promise me not to visit me for at least a hundred years or more. Oh! would you go by and visit my mother in law later today?
4,0,0,The good news is they might sentence you to death.
1,1,1,You should have told me about the scythe.
4,0,0,I offered to hire a stylist for the trial, remember?
3,1,0,If he asks if you have no sense of decency, plead the Fifth.
1,2,0,He'll commute your sentence if you give him ten years.
4,0,0,I know that I told you to dress as though going to Church.
2,1,1,I get it, 'Death and Taxes'!
3,1,0,I'm afraid they'll give you life.
3,1,0,Lets keep it to ourselves that all your potential character witnesses pre-deceased you.
3,1,0,Take the plea.
4,0,0,We'll argue that trying this case as a capital offense is redundant.
2,1,1,No. The death penalty is not just a time out.
4,0,0,I can get you life with a chance of parole after a century. Take it or leave it.
3,1,0,With a little luck, I can get you life.
4,0,0,Death, be not proud.
3,1,0,A recommendation for mercy might be a tough sell.
2,2,0,I hope the judge sees the irony in sentencing you to death.
3,1,0,I don't think fingerprints will be the only acceptable identification.
2,1,0,Self-defense may be a problem.
3,1,0,Who exactly has been ripping off and profiting from your graffiti designs?
3,0,1,I'll ask for an adjournment to save face
2,0,1,As your counsel, I strongly advise you not to always close your statements with 'because I can'.
3,1,0,Is that a new style huddie with a tail!
4,0,0,You may be my Ghost Writer, but I'll telling the truth!
2,2,0,According to my file, the prosecution rests tomorrow.
4,0,0,in Under no circumstances do I want you to look directly at the jury.
2,1,1,Grim reaper, I think we have an excellent case against death and taxes
3,1,0,I take it you're familiar with the death penalty.
3,1,0,No, the phrase “Death Penalty” is not an oxymoron.
4,0,0,Let's Face it, they're not gonna bite on invisibility alibi.
4,0,0,Hey, at least we know the death penalty is off the table.
2,2,0,The death penalty is off the table, not that it matters.
3,0,0,Weirdly, no one wants to challenge your testimony.
4,0,0,Remember Eye Contact
4,0,0,On a positive note they took the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,They're gonna big-scythe you. Want fried with that?
4,0,0,Best-case scenario, I get you the death penalty.
4,0,0,Levitate to the stand and show the jury that you're not just another ass in a costume.
3,1,0,No fingerprints on the scythe - they haven't got a case.
4,0,0,'The justice system sucks' is not actually an admissible plea.
3,0,0,No more jokes about requesting the death penalty, OK?
3,1,0,No... I'm afraid it's life... without parole!
4,0,0,Have a snickers when court recesses...you're not you when your hungry.
2,1,1,No, you can't be judge, jury, and executioner.
2,1,1,As your attorney, I must warn you that the court has a strict no hoodie policy.
2,1,1,You of all people should have realized the certainty of taxes
1,0,2,I say we go with the, "identity theft" defense.
3,1,0,I'll bush hard for the death sentence, but I fear you may get life.
3,1,0,They're going for the You Penalty
4,0,0,You should plead Inevitability.
4,0,0,We just took the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Yes I think at least one juror is intimidated
3,1,0,Juries don't really like when their defendants wear hoodies.
3,0,1,How would you feel about a plea bargain- Life sentence without parole?
3,0,0,Do I have to go right now, or can I call my wife and say I won't be home for awhile?
4,0,0,They want to impose the Life Penalty.
4,0,0,It may be a case of mistaken identity
3,0,0,For God's sake, what did you expect? The penalty is actually named after you!
3,1,0,Stick with "Death doesn't kill people - people kill people," and you'll be fine.
3,1,0,He’s impressed by your attempt to conjugate the Latin verb habeo, but rules that you cannot present your Writ of Habeam Corpus.
3,1,0,Try to look sympathetic.
2,2,0,Don't give me that look
4,0,0,I told you not to wear that outfit for the trial.
4,0,0,The jury's deadlocked.
2,2,0,We're going to need a better argument than "It was his time."
3,0,0,Since the hood didn't fit, they must acquit.
2,1,1,We are going to ask for the death penalty and have you remanded into your own custody.
3,0,1,My people do not communicat well with your people.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but the judge thinks you're a risk to the community.
4,0,0,If you are lucky the judge might make you do some community service.
3,1,0,Tell Scalia this isn't a second amendment case
3,1,0,Lawyer: "Remember, they were dead when you got there."
3,1,0,Try not to show any emotion.
2,1,0,At least we got the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,You’re my first client to request the death penalty.
3,0,0,We should go with the "If the scythe don't fit, you must acquit defense."
3,1,0,I really thought his time was up!
3,1,0,At this time the defense rests in peace.
3,1,0,Ok. Now, remember. The key is to make sure you don't get life.
4,0,0,You could get life.
4,0,0,When you take the stand, don't be yourself.
4,0,0,Worst case, Prison of Life, no chance for parole.
1,1,0,Can we take the death penalty off the table?
3,1,0,It's hard to say if the death penalty applies in your case.
3,0,0,The devil made me do it!
4,0,0,Are you for or against the death penalty?
3,0,0,The good news is, we should be done by lunch.
4,0,0,Looks like the Supreme Court is tied -- four say he's dead, four say he's alive.
2,0,2,Remember, your scythe is cutting wheat.
0,3,1,I'd actually recommend not making eye contact.
4,0,0,If all else fails we are going for a death sentence.
3,1,0,So you're in favor of the death penalty?
4,0,0,The typo was my fault; it should not have read "habeas corpse."
3,0,0,It might help if you smiled at the jury.
4,0,0,You understand that life is not an option, in prison or anywhere else.
0,3,1,I know you are used to settling things out of court . . .
3,0,0,I don't think they'll push for the death penalty.
2,2,0,You're dealing with the IRS, so you might hold back on the death and taxes jokes.
3,1,0,As long as you assure me this is your first offense . . .
2,1,1,Didn't I tell you to wear a coat and tie.
2,1,0,I know you don't do bargains but would you make an exception for this plea?
4,0,0,I think I get you life.
2,0,2,How do you know their lead witness won't testify?
3,1,0,Let's go over it again, we're trying to AVOID the death penalty.
2,1,0,No, I don't think we can subpoena members of Blue Oyster Cult to take the stand in your defense.
3,1,0,In your case the death penalty is probably moot.
3,1,0,Nice try, but a writ of habeas corpse won't cut it.
2,2,0,Self defense. Really???
3,1,0,Just to make sure I understand you, are you hoping the jury reached a Death Penalty verdict?
1,2,1,The defense rests in peace.
4,0,0,The statute of limitations has expired on your case against Methuselah.
2,1,0,Don't take this personally, but the outlook is grim.
4,0,0,I'd say we have a pretty cut-and-dry case of profiling here.
3,0,1,It's not good. Word is the prosecutor is going for 'murder everyone'.
4,0,0,Umm, that whole "I am not the one who pleads" thing probably didn't help your case.
4,0,0,Are you SURE the Devil made you do it?
1,2,0,Stay calm. A 'hung jury' is just a figure of speech.
3,1,0,Well, sure, why not? Go ahead and testify. They won't know who you are anyway.
4,0,0,Surrender the scythe; you walk.
2,2,0,I know it's warm in here, but DO NOT take off your hoodie!!!
3,1,0,You're wasting your time. He's a millionaire.
1,1,1,I'm having a difficult time finding a witness to confirm your alibis.
3,1,0,Whatever happens, you don't want to appear too...what's the word I'm looking for...
3,0,0,So it's not technically a hoodie. It still gives the jury an impression of menace.
4,0,0,Tell the judge I'm not entirely comfortable with the courts choice of my representation.
2,1,0,You couldn't find a nice suit and button down shirt to wear?
4,0,0,Remember - don't take your scythe to the stand.
0,3,0,Try to be less grim.
2,1,1,'Their time was up' is not a good defense.
2,0,0,Congratulations, it's a hung jury.
4,0,0,Well, that's not what they mean by the hanging judge...
2,2,0,I'm going to be honest -- it's looking grim.
0,3,1,I'll try to get you life.
3,0,0,I know, but this is a civil case, not a death penalty trial.
2,2,0,Don't be offended. They say everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
4,0,0,You want to plead the fifth? Why?
4,0,0,No, you shouldn't take the stand.
4,0,0,Let's try for a plea devil's bargain.
4,0,0,So there's no other kind of "force" you're aware of using as an alibi?
4,0,0,I don't intend to put you on the stand.
3,1,0,Don't worry - it's a jury of your pyres.
2,1,1,My hunch is the most submitted caption will be: "Could you act a little less grim?"
3,0,1,No, I don't think that telling the judge that you were responsible for the death of all people since the beginning of time has helped our defense.
2,1,1,No, I maintain that "his time had come" is not an effective defense.
4,0,0,Grimm, can you take it easy with the chain rattling? You're scaring the jury.
3,0,0,Of course, they have solid DNA evidence. It WAS the Plague.
4,0,0,Our chances are Grim to none and Grim just left town.
3,0,1,Your chances look grim.
3,1,0,I've always wondered....how do you eat?
3,0,0,Dude, I think that the writ of Habeas Corpus is in play here...
3,0,1,The chances of a conviction are grim.
2,1,0,OK but when you're on the stand don't be so grim.
2,0,2,Relax, I got Taxes off scot-free.
3,0,1,When the judge says "death", that means a penalty, not an occupation.
3,0,1,Sorry; this state does not have the death penalty.
1,3,0,Given ALL of your priors, I have to say, it doesn't look good.
3,1,0,Just don't react when the judge mentions the death penalty.
2,2,0,I think we should go with the insanity plea.
3,1,0,Would it have killed you to put on a tie?
3,1,0,Gassed or electrocuted ?
4,0,0,We should avoid the life sentence for you.
4,0,0,On the bright side, the transition will be a breeze.
4,0,0,Jurors like humility. Don't keep saying that you're certain.
3,0,0,You have no chance of suing an airport because you were not allowed to board.
4,0,0,For the last time, I'm not going to say "If the gloves don't fit, you must acquit!"
2,1,1,Poker face, not blank stare.
4,0,0,If you want to sue to model for "The Scream," you'll have to lose the hood
3,1,0,Don't worry, we've got a killer strategy.
2,2,0,I think our best strategy at this point would be for you to casually put your hand on the prosecutor's shoulder.
3,1,0,How about going forward I handle the jokes.
4,0,0,See, I told you your sickle wouldn't make it through the metal detector.
2,2,0,Yes, you can plead self-defense if you're not bothered by loud laughter.
1,3,0,I know Angel Of Death is your real name, let's just go with Irving Lipschitz, like we discussed.
2,2,0,Let's forget about eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,Your outfit doesn't exactly scream "Innocent."
4,0,0,It was her idea to put it in the vows: "Till Death do us part."
4,0,0,Don't worry. Even if we lose, you can just slip right out of the cell.
4,0,0,So, . . . Explain to me again how you made partner. . .
3,0,0,Don't worry. They can't get a positive ID on your face.
4,0,0,Their witness may try to throw some shade.
3,1,0,Please don't tell the sentencing judge that you're a long term advocate of the death penalty.
3,0,1,The verdict is looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,No, I said I need a deft defense.
3,1,0,Leave it on: nameless and faceless relates more to Everyman.
3,1,0,We'll prove the Grand Jury your actions were perfectly commensurate with your duties...
4,0,0,Frankly, this is my first death penalty case.
4,0,0,Did anybody see you do it?
3,0,0,I told you security would take your scythe.
2,2,0,You couldn't have worn a suit?
4,0,0,You're starting to make me feel like my case doesn't have a chance
4,0,0,Yes, I suppose you would like to see a hung jury.
4,0,0,Wear a tie, take the fifth.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, it's looking like he can cheat you.
3,1,0,You gotta lose the hoodie
4,0,0,Watch carefully. I'm going to kill this.
4,0,0,Give me an acquittal or give me death.
4,0,0,I mean, I wouldn't say I'm 'religious' but I definitely would call myself 'spiritual'.
3,1,0,This will be the biggest serial killer trial ever.
1,3,0,I have to be honest. Things are looking pretty grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,You told me to keep a low profile.
2,1,1,I thought this was a sentence you would be comfortable with . . .
1,1,2,They are having a tough time gathering a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,Please stop looking that way towards the jurors.
4,0,0,So this is what you are going with,what are you? who are you?
0,3,0,I'm cautiously pessimistic.
4,0,0,They're willing to take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,1,Look, I can buy you some time, but you're gonna have to pay those back taxes.
4,0,0,If we don't plea you could get the death penalty.
2,0,1,Because he was just so annoying? That's our defense?
4,0,0,If they find you guilty, you'll get the Death Penalty.
3,1,0,Of course in your case the death penalty is not a viable option.
2,0,2,Well, a life sentence would be pretty ironic.
3,0,0,I think you should take the Fifth
4,0,0,At least the death penalty is off the table." At least the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,1,You've got to stop pointing at the jurors
4,0,0,I'm not your homie, know wha' mean?
3,0,0,If we lose, you get life.
1,2,0,At least the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,Well, they are asking for the death penalty, but the good news is that they don't quite know how that would work in your case.
3,0,0,I said dress trim, not grim.
3,1,0,This is my first death penalty case!
4,0,0,You are lucky. Death has not been outlawed in this state.
3,0,0,What happened to the ghost of Christmas past? He was Scrooge's key witness!
1,1,2,Being dead is usually a good alibi.
4,0,0,We won, but apparently cheating Death is a crime punishable by applause.
2,1,0,There is one big hole in our case.
4,0,0,Let's stay real here - And that means no more 'ghost-of-a-chance' opinions.
4,0,0,Let's open with a statement about all the times when you changed your mind.
4,0,0,It's looking grim... I can't get you off the hook
3,1,0,Stop looking so grim.
2,2,0,Without the scythe I don’t think they have a case.
1,2,1,We need to do better than "it's my job."
1,2,0,Not a word.
3,1,0,Could you at least walk? The floating across the room thing isn't helping us.
4,0,0,I fully support your decision to defend yourself.
3,1,0," I know it's your job, but I don't think that will work with the jury".
4,0,0,You want to plead "inevitability"? Are you sure?
4,0,0,Seriously. It's called a death 'penalty.'
4,0,0,Remember, it's not just you. It's taxes.
3,0,0,Sorry, evenen though you're Death, you still can't escape taxes...
4,0,0,I agree, speaking in public is scarier than death
3,1,0,When I said 'Wear your dark suit,' I meant the Brooks Brothers one.
4,0,0,Be transparent.
2,2,0,Yes, it's slimming, but it's not helping your defense.
4,0,0,You tried to sneak your scythe past security again, didn't you?
1,3,0,I'd say your prospects look grim.
2,0,2,Good news. They're willing to take Death off the table.
4,0,0,No, I don't think using the untimely death of Mildred Potter as an alibi will help your case.
3,1,0,I know you’re upset, but they won't issue you the death penalty for failing to pay last year's income taxes!
3,0,0,Hung jury it is.
3,0,1,This judge has no soul
3,1,0,How many did you say St. Peter stole?
4,0,0,You were involved in 9/11 too? That's it! I'm the only one who would take your case, so if you want to beat this then from now on, you tell me everything.
4,0,0,You're looking at Life without a plea.
4,0,0,Tomorrow leave the scythe at home...your at work...this is a court house...mmmk?
2,2,0,Your moral objections to the death penalty are surprising, but duly noted.
3,1,0,They want a restraining order.
2,2,0,The offer is"Death without the possibility of parole".
2,2,0,Try not to point at this new judge.
4,0,0,Things are looking pretty grim I'm afraid.
3,1,0,the seventh seal defense may not be our best option here
3,0,1,I think it might be best if we just have you plead the fifth.
3,1,0,Try to let the jury see your lighter side.
4,0,0,Remember, "The pending legislation does NOT create death panels."
3,1,0,Is that business formal where you come from?
4,0,0,Are you sure you want to go through with this appeals process?
3,1,0,It's not genocide if you killed without regard to race, creed or color.
2,1,0,Well, of course justice is blind. Let's face it though, in your case, they'll see right through you.
3,0,0,I don't think the judge will buy that your name is Annon E. Muss
3,1,0,He sentenced you to life, just for the irony.
4,0,0,No I can't use the movie Ghost as your alibi!
4,0,0,Well, I do appreciate the irony. But, I still doubt a mens rea defense will work--since you, of all people, should know that you had to pay your taxes by the 15th.
4,0,0,Don't worry, there's an obvious hole in their case
4,0,0,I Heard that the judge has a bad ticker
1,1,1,You'll get the last laugh.
2,1,0,Must you be so doom and gloom about everything?
4,0,0,Now is not the time to write poems.
4,0,0,I Think that I think that you must me more forthcoming than that.
3,1,0,Your Honor, my client utilizes an agricultural hand tool, professionally.
3,1,0,Trust me, nolo contendere in civil court.
4,0,0,No. I would not recommend that you testify.
4,0,0,Sorry, this is New York. You can't demand the death penalty
3,1,0,The judge denied your Writ of Habeas Corpse
4,0,0,You realize that 'strike the juror' is not to be taken literally...
2,1,1,You sure you want to enter a guilty plea...You'll be sentenced to 'Life'.
3,0,1,As your attorney, I strongly advise that you stop making eye contact with the jurors.
4,0,0,It's admissible as a dying declaration
4,0,0,Bad luck; this judge is pro-life.
3,0,1,It's probably unethical for me to say this, but I think we have a better shot if you take out jurors four and seven.
2,0,2,Yes, I believe that would be considered jury tampering.
3,1,0,Face it. The verdict may be grim.
4,0,0,You see, I usually try to keep my clients off death row.
2,1,1,You won't be needed today, it's only traffic court.
3,0,0,Would it kill you to smile at the jury once in a while?
3,0,0,Just because is not a motive.
3,0,0,With a little luck, you’ll get life.
3,1,0,Good point. The death penalty would be a bit redundant.
4,0,0,The bad news is you lost. The good news is you're getting Life.
3,0,0,I don't think that holding out for "life" in prison is a reasonable option.
3,1,0,I think I can get you eternity without parole.
4,0,0,Don't look at me like that.
3,1,0,Bad news from the DA: the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,She wants to keep the house.
4,0,0,Habeus corpus?
4,0,0,Bergman still won't settle - insists you're 'public domain'.
3,0,1,Do you care if the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty?
2,2,0,Stop looking at the jury. You're creeping them out.
4,0,0,I think you should opt for the guillotine
3,1,0,No, an appearance is never optional.
1,1,0,Is you-know-what still on the table?
4,0,0,Wait, I'M just an empty suit?
3,0,0,The prosecutor says that if you don't accept a life term, he'll be seeking a death sentence... I'm not sure what that means here.
3,1,0,By the way, I really wouldn't mind if you chose to go "pro se."
4,0,0,What did you do now Death
4,0,0,Yes, things look grim.
3,1,0,You're my first client to ask for the death penalty.
4,0,0,They need you to sentence yourself to death.
3,0,0,Remember, when they swear you in, you can't say 'Lucifer !'
4,0,0,I suppose the Legend of Sleepy Hillow defense is an idea
4,0,0,Remember, don't make eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,What do you think they do once the 20 minute limit is up?
3,1,0,They've offered a deal. Plead guilty to four billion counts of murder and they'll drop the rest of the charges ...
3,1,0,Can you tell from looking at the scythe whether it's yours?
4,0,0,Does the Angel of Death have any ideas? Because I'm out of ideas.
3,1,0,Grim, I want to be on the record for advising you that hoodies are not appropriate in the courtroom.
3,0,0,You're going to have to appear before the jury, okay?
4,0,0,Don't worry, they can't give you life.
4,0,0,Any mitigating circumstances? We could go with Childhood abuse, maybe.
3,1,0,We can do this, but you've got to lose the hood.
2,1,1,Remember what we rehearsed--you were on holiday.
4,0,0,Okay, so we agree; I'm going to go with 'If the scythe doesn't fit, you must acquit.'
1,3,0,Frankly, the hoodie isn't helping.
1,2,1,This should be a slam dunk. The prosecution has no eyewitnesses!
3,1,0,You should come out with us. Your poker face is awesome.
4,0,0,I rest my case?
1,2,0,It would help your case if you stopped slowly pointing at each member of the jury.
2,2,0,I told you business casual!
4,0,0,To gain the jury's sympathy I advise you to be not proud.
4,0,0,We wouldn't be if you had worn a suit.
3,1,0,We’ll sow doubt that you profile the elderly.
3,1,0,Maybe it would have been better if you had not said, "Hey, it's my job".
3,1,0,You went to Vassar with Bob? His brother, Jim used to live in my building. Small world.
2,0,1,Let me do the talking. Nobody wants to hear from you.
3,1,0,I think we're looking at a hung jury.
4,0,0,Thank god, any mention of Death penalty is off the table.
2,1,1,Would it have hurt you to wear a suit and tie for once?
4,0,0,What do you mean I'm not getting into heaven?
4,0,0,Now it's up to the Commission whether we get out patent for making flesh invisible.
4,0,0,It would help your case if you smiled!
4,0,0,You'd already sold the scythe on Kijiji, right?
4,0,0,'Seriously? That's your only suit?'
2,1,1,Sure, I know you'd like a death sentence.
4,0,0,Would you settle for life?
3,0,0,Just remember. We're pleading ex post facto.
3,1,0,Show your compassionate side.
3,0,0,I doubt that postponing the execution in your case will help.
3,0,0,Were you read your rites?
4,0,0,I know there is no way of stopping you, but thank you for at least participating in our judicial system.
3,0,1,I’ll take the part on tax evasion.
1,1,2,I want you to be aware that this might go class action.
2,0,2,People have been cheating you for years, you're due compensation.
4,0,0,We need to save face on this
3,0,1,Pretty safe to say the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,You can't convict what you can't see . Worth a try.
3,1,0,No, murder for hire starts next week. This one is conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
4,0,0,Look death I know you came here to defend your killing off of the middle class, but we already have the Koch Brothers doing that.
2,2,0,Just don't make eye contact with the jurors.
3,1,0,No, you can't have your scythe in the courtroom.
4,0,0,I didn't realize that parking in a Fire Lane was now a capital crime.
3,1,0,Exactly what part of "suit and tie" didn't you get?
4,0,0,You don't have much color and a neck tie would have been nice
1,3,0,You could get life, but you don't want that, do you?
4,0,0,Our defense is going to be that you were "paranormal" at the time of the robbery.
3,0,0,You should have gone with the suit and tie.
4,0,0,Turns out Double Jeopardy does not prevent them from executing you again. Bummer.
3,0,1,The judge would like to hear your thoughts on the death penalty.
3,0,1,You can't hang the jury yourself.
4,0,0,Look, I don't want you coming across like just another empty suit.
4,0,0,If they ask about lawn mowing, mention your Bad Boy MZ.
1,1,1,I told you to wear a shirt and tie... and for Pete's sake don't bring that scythe again.
4,0,0,I though we agree you would smile
4,0,0,Mort, where are the jurors? You didn't...
3,1,0,OK. Let me explain something about an affirmative defense. First, you must stop replying to every question with "Damn you!"
4,0,0,Do you have your voter I.D. card with you?
2,1,0,In this courtroom, you are, at best, jury and executioner.
1,2,1,Bad news, they gave you Life.
4,0,0,I must have told them 100 times it tastes like concrete!
3,0,0,There are pluses and minuses to taking the stand in one’s own defense. In your case I would go with the minuses.
3,0,0,This is where I usually say 'keep a stiff upper lip'.
2,2,0,What's the worst that could happen?
4,0,0,I don't think you can plea bargain for the death penalty
2,0,1,Lose the hoody
3,1,0,In all the years as a defense lawyer, you are my first hallow case.
0,3,1,As your lawyer, I'm advising you not to say anything about your support for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Wipe that smile off your face. It's looking grim for you.
4,0,0,Don't you think you're getting a bit overzealous? It's only an embezzlement case,
4,0,0,Okay--she's offering joint custody of the other three housemen, but she wants the beach house in return.
4,0,0,Remember: deny everything.
4,0,0,I'm pleading life. You okay with that?
4,0,0,But they don't accept testimony from the deceased.y
4,0,0,The 'Death Warmed Over' routine isn't working.
4,0,0,What do you mean by natural causes?
3,1,0,In this case, the death penalty is basically just house arrest.
1,1,0,I might be able to get them to accept five to ten - if you'll throw in an extra five years for the judge...
1,3,0,Did you have something to do with the hung jury?
3,1,0,Know anything about a scythe?
3,1,0,I think you can take down your hoodie now.
3,1,0,I think we should plead the death penalty.
2,1,1,You are making the jury uneasy!
3,1,0,We've got this. I think the jury likes you.
4,0,0,I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, but your chances of an acquittal are grim
2,2,0,I don't say this lightly, Greg. You killed it up there on on the witness stand.
2,2,0,Worst case, they give you life.
3,0,1,Great news, the prosecutor is going for the death penalty.
4,0,0,I really don't think claiming self-defense is a good idea.
3,0,0,...and if the jury finds you guilty, try not to strike down the foreman.
3,1,0,I recommend that you take the Fifth.
4,0,0,Remember to plead the Fifth if they ask you about your work with terrorists.
3,1,0,Will you defend me to the death?
3,0,0,Like I said, this outcome is not dead certain.
4,0,0,Sorry, I couldn't find anything else to wear
3,0,0,Your employment history is impeccable.
3,0,0,They can't make the terrorism charges stick.
4,0,0,We'll win on appeal. We'll call the horsemen as witnesses.
3,0,0,I am confident I can get the death penalty off the table.
2,1,0,I recommend not mentioning your work the elderly.
3,0,1,You may be a good teacher, but you still killed all your students.
3,1,0,Still, the jury needs to see eye contact.
3,1,0,Just be yourself and look hard at every jury member.
1,2,0,"Could you at least have worn a tie"!
4,0,0,Their case for accessory after the fact is looking pretty strong
3,0,0,Sure, I can do your taxes first.
4,0,0,Telling Juror #8 that his time is near did not help your case.
4,0,0,As your attorney I must advise you there is no way I can request a hung jury or a deadlocked jury in my closing argument!
4,0,0,Sorry, but no, sir, they don't validate parking.
3,1,0,No, they won't give you the death penalty for tax evasion.
2,0,1,Maybe you should wear a tie.
3,1,0,How could you not know you had to pay taxes?
4,0,0,So you say your legal experience is in futures?
3,0,0,Don't worry, they only got you on tax evasion.
3,1,0,What is it that you don't understand about habeas corpus?
4,0,0,You're going to need a tax attorney.
4,0,0,You've taken this Niqab thing to a whole new level.
3,0,0,...they are seeking life in prison.
2,2,0,I plead non compos mentis.
3,1,0,Honestly things are looking grim. They have a killer case against you.
2,1,0,The firm has been working me to death.
4,0,0,Things look pretty grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Ironically, the death penalty is still in the table
3,1,0,I am here for the writ of habeas corpus.
3,0,0,No, rigor mortis is NOT covered under habeas corpus.
3,1,0,I think you and I have a different definition of hung jury
3,1,0,Fine, you can take me. But may I first moon the jury?
4,0,0,I'd can't stay and handle your case because I've got an appointment in Samarra.
3,0,0,Sorry, there is no 5th Amendment protection equivalent based on how you look!
2,1,0,Visiting the judge in his quarters won't help your case.
2,2,0,Is that your only suit?
3,1,0,Yes, I'm sure. I wiped all the fingerprints off the scythe.
1,1,2,Fortunately, the scythe is inadmissible as evidence
2,2,0,I think we have to drop the self-defense plea.
3,0,1,Well..do I even have time to finish this brief?
3,1,0,You'll be lucky to get life.
3,0,1,I'm expecting another hung jury.
4,0,0,Don't worry. They can't give you the death penalty, suicide is illegal.
4,0,0,No eyewitnesses, but you still don't look innocent to the jury.
1,0,3,Their case is strong. Brace yourself: You may get life.
3,1,0,Brace yourself for the possibility of a Death sentence.
4,0,0,Good news. Several jurors are Trump voters.
3,0,1,Stick to the story. You are personally opposed to the death penalty.
4,0,0,They have the right to face their accuser.
1,2,1,Self defense? Each time?
3,1,0,I think asking for the death penalty might create a conflict of interests.
3,1,0,Would you be mad if you heard I don't believe in the death penalty?
3,1,0,Nice Tie
2,1,0,I don't think " He was just doing his job" will cut it with this jury.
3,1,0,There's a good chance you could get life...
4,0,0,This is The People's Court. Dead Reckoning is upstairs.
3,0,0,Would be best to keep your job out of the alibi.
3,1,0,This is not the time for hide and seek!!
4,0,0,Let's stop with the footsie, and try to keep this professional.
3,1,0,Don't worry, they can't sentence you to you.
4,0,0,My last lawyer seemed more optimistic!
4,0,0,Not now! I'll finish this paperwork if it kills me...
4,0,0,You need to get that blank look off your face.
3,1,0,I think the Workers Comp judge isn't convinced your injury is preventing you from performing your job- his cousin just died.
2,1,0,Don't worry, I rehearsed: if the sickle doesn't fit, you must acquit.
3,0,0,Seriously? You want me to tell them you didn't reap the benefits?
4,0,0,I know your the Grim Reaper, but do you have to wear that outfit in court?
4,0,0,I will not let you take the stand wearing that "hoody" it will send the wrong message to the jury.
3,1,0,Remember, they were already dead when you showed up.
2,1,1,I'm sorry; life without parole. I know you had your heart set on the death penalty.
3,0,0,I advise you to settle: mistaking "inevitable" for "evitable" in the case of taxes just won't fly.
3,1,0,Without the hoodie you'd have a better chance.
3,0,0,Well, I guess they didn't go for the insanity defense.
2,2,0,At least death is off the table.
4,0,0,So your explanation is that they were dead when you got there...
3,1,0,Don't throw yourself upon the mercy of the court. Remember, you want the death penalty.
3,1,0,Do me a favor and just point a finger at the jurors a few times during the trial.
4,0,0,We have an air-tight defense--use of the scythe is protected by the Second Amendment.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, it turns out the saying is correct. Taxes are as certain as you are.
4,0,0,Remember, to the jury you're just a faceless number.
4,0,0,Don't worry, there's no death penalty in this state but you might get life... OK?
3,0,0,Can you just keep your hands to your self form once.
4,0,0,Look at it this way -- the worst that'll happen is that you'll get the death penalty.
2,2,0,I'm confident. Everyone on the jury is over 80
3,0,0,Well fortunately, aside from all the evidence mounted against you, I think we can safely rule out the death penalty.
3,0,0,Not to worry. They don't have prima facial evidence.
3,1,0,We're going to plead insanity.
4,0,0,I predict a hung jury.
4,0,0,Here again.
4,0,0,Now remember, our defense is that you were just following orders.
3,1,0,Plead the scythe.
2,1,1,No, you can't request a hung jury.
4,0,0,Jurors tend to look at someone like you as just an empty suit
2,1,1,The best I can get for you is life without parole.
3,1,0,You sure you want to stick with the Holy Ghost defense?
3,1,0,Let's make this easy--don't show your face.
4,0,0,You sure nobody saw you on the crime scene?
4,0,0,So you weren't identified in the lineup?
4,0,0,The jury wants to know if the death penalty is off the table in your case
3,0,1,The best I could do is life in prison.
3,0,0,They're demanding the you penalty.
3,0,0,Just sweet talk 'em
4,0,0,Remember here death hath no dominion.
4,0,0,I'm not sure that this is the time and place to be rockin' a hoodie.
3,0,0,Expecto patr- pat- pa. . .[silence].
4,0,0,It looks as if we have a hung jury.
3,0,1,Chances are, you'll really like Death Row.
4,0,0,We can make the motion, but I'm pretty sure it's still going to be called life imprisonment.
2,2,0,Relax. The worst that can happen is you'll get sentenced to yourself.
1,1,1,In your case, I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the hoodie.
4,0,0,I told you not to try the robe on. The fact that it fits hurts our case.
3,1,0,Just remember, you're the one who was cheated.
4,0,0,I'm going to ask you once last time—did you kill this man?
2,1,1,Not gonna lie, Mr. Reaper. It looks grim.
3,1,0,Frankly, it doesn't look good.
4,0,0,No. It's an illegal U-turn and a first offense. We shouldn't ask for more than a fine.
1,0,3,Know of any newly available rent-controlled apartments?
2,2,0,Some good news: they don't have fingerprints.
4,0,0,I don't think the death penalty will be an issue for you.
4,0,0,I'll call you as an expert witness during the penalty phase.
3,1,0,We're going to call it a 'butter knife.'
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but a life sentence is non-negotiable.
4,0,0,We're going to try to plead it down to being the anthropomorphic personification of involuntary manslaughter.
3,1,0,Technically, death is a penalty.
3,1,0,Relax..you're in good hands. I got Taxes off on a technicality last week.
4,0,0,Plead mythology.
2,2,0,Reject the premise of existence.
4,0,0,oh man no omen!
3,1,0,Now, when you ask if the death penalty is an option, how exactly do you mean that?
4,0,0,I wouldn't worry. Their evidence is purely circumstantial.
3,1,0,The plaintiff is claiming a loss in future earnings
3,1,0,They're willing to drop the homicide charge if you plead guilty to misdemeanor theft of a scythe
2,2,0,And whatever you do, do not stare at the jury.
4,0,0,I thought you of all people would know only two things in life are certain?
3,1,0,If the pumpkin does not fit, they must acquit!
4,0,0,Did you get your sickle through the metal detector?
4,0,0,Don't worry - they can't give me life.
4,0,0,But the victim identified you out of a line-up!
4,0,0,I'm glad this isn't the court of public opinion.
4,0,0,They're going for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Are you on board with our seeking the death penalty?
3,0,1," The best we can do is Life without any chance of parole".
4,0,0,His penchant for cheeseburgers definitely constitutes mitigating circumstances.
4,0,0,I don't think the jury is going to buy the 'Dead men tell no tales' defense.
4,0,0,What they're gonna argue is that a death sentence saves lives.
3,1,0,Hi, I'm the devil's advocate.
2,1,0,Try not to be so grim.
2,2,0,No, it is not customary for the defendant to shake the prosecutor’s hand when the trial is over.
4,0,0,If your found guilty you could get life.
3,1,0,Trust me, without the scythe, they've got no case.
4,0,0,Please don't do your victory dance if they find you guilty.
4,0,0,By showing remorse, we can avoid the death penalty.
3,1,0,No one on the jury recognizes your face but they all know your name.
2,1,1,I've got good news, they're seeking the death penalty.
3,1,0,You get weekends and Easter.
3,1,0,I told you NOT to dress casual.
4,0,0,Stuff it Ms. Muffitt!! Stuff it Ms. Muffitt!!
2,2,0,I don't care about your image. Take the manslaughter plea.
4,0,0,From beyond the grave Mr. Drumph insists, "I'll sue!"
2,1,0,We might be over playing the "pain and suffering" bit ...
4,0,0,Are you my shadow counsel?
4,0,0,Your defense needs brightening.
3,0,1,I'm glad I've got you as my lawyer.
3,0,1,I'm feeling sort of grim about the verdict.
3,1,0,Would a suit and tie have killed you?
3,1,0,Their case is kaput once the DA's witness has to ID you!
3,0,1,You should plea 'guilty' and hope for the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you to wear the blue cloak.
4,0,0,You're giving me a devil of a time.
3,1,0,Our defense is looking rather grim, Mr. Reaper
3,1,0,Don't worry, the witness didn't see a thing.
1,3,0,I know you'd prefer a hung jury.
3,1,0,Now I want you to give them your sunny-ist smile
4,0,0,Hoodie vs. suit and tie? The debate continues.
2,2,0,The jury would see right through you.
4,0,0,Well 'Death', if that is your real name, 'I am a lawyer.' It's you who should be worried.
4,0,0,I can get you a deal if you can live with it.
4,0,0,We'll plead insanity, because you have no head.
4,0,0,I'm not sure if our "Grim Reaper" defense will hold up in this murder case, but, we'll give it a shot!
4,0,0,This could go either way.
3,1,0,It's just a formality. You'll win in the end.
3,1,0,I'd leave the scythe under the table.
3,0,0,Assisted suicide is your best defence.
3,1,0,Good News is, New York has no death penalty.
3,1,0,Sorry. I couldn't find any character witnesses.
4,0,0,Your chances look pretty grim.
2,2,0,Unfortunately, the judge does not believe the rule against perpetuities applies.
4,0,0,Fake like your devastated if the judge sentences you to death.
0,2,2,We're good, as long as they don't bring up your priors
4,0,0,I told you, dress like you are going to church, not to Hell.
3,1,0,That's not exactly the dark suit I had in mind for you.
3,0,0,If you can win this case, I'll owe you everything.
4,0,0,I'd recommend you make an appearance before this particular committee
2,1,0,It's inevitable. You're gonna have to pay taxes.
4,0,0,Three parking tickets, really?
1,0,2,Don't worry. We were able to dig up a couple of witnesses.
4,0,0,You needn't look so grim.
2,2,0,This is traffic court. The death penalty case is down the hall.
3,1,0,They're arguing that the plaintiff's life was not yours to take.
4,0,0,You're not going to get a better deal than life.
3,1,0,Ah you really meant it when you said a life sentence just wouldn't be possible.
3,0,1,When I said you should hide your head in shame, I didn't expect you would take it literally.
4,0,0,No problem; it was just an unfortunate accident that happened when the deceased borrowed your scythe to mow his lawn, as so many had before.
3,1,0,What do you mean, look on the bright side?
3,1,0,G R, do you have a change of clothing?
3,0,1,The DA assured me the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,Mr. Reaper, I think it's advisable to start wearing a suit to these proceedings.
2,1,0,As your tax attorney, I have to tell you, the outcome looks pretty certain.
2,1,0,We'll get him next time.
4,0,0,You had to know the guards would take your scythe.
3,1,0,Technically, that would be jury tampering.
2,2,0,No, the jury of your peers thing doesn’t mean they have to dress like you.
4,0,0,Well? Did you do it?
4,0,0,Okay, when the new judge arrives, please let me do all the objecting and pointing of fingers.
3,1,0,It means produce the body, not bring him back from hell.
4,0,0,I don't swear in.
4,0,0,Looks like you've made it to Death Row again.
2,2,0,Offshore. Underworld. Either way, you're fine.
4,0,0,I know you have been doing this job for eternity but as I told you before, “I was just doing my job” is not a defense the jury is going to buy.
4,0,0,The prosecution will bargain if you swap kale for butter.
3,0,1,No, I'm sorry this is not a death penalty state.
3,0,0,It simple,tell them why you were in Samara and get rid of the hoodie
3,1,0,Don't worry about the death penalty
4,0,0,At least they can't hang you.
4,0,0,Don't worry, the jury will love you. You're an angel!
4,0,0,I expected you to look more relieved at a verdict of "involuntary manslaughter."
3,1,0,Remain silent, like you're not here.
3,1,0,We can call most of these self-defense and the rest entrapment.
4,0,0,Our best hope is for a hung jury.
4,0,0,As good a attorney as I am, I can't bring you back from Hell.
3,1,0,I hope the jury supports the death penalty.
4,0,0,Listen, J.J. Abrams will cameo you in the last 90 seconds, is that cool?
3,1,0,With your background, I recommend you cop a plea.
4,0,0,I woke up with this feeling that things are looking up for me today.
3,1,0,Don't be proud.
4,0,0,You might be sentenced to life...
3,1,0,Would it kill you to let ME do the talking?
3,0,0,Is there any chance you could do something about Jurors 3 and 11 during the lunch recess?
4,0,0,I keep explaining to you that we can't ask for the death penalty in a civil case.
4,0,0,O.J. are you in there?
4,0,0,You gave them the gun and cigarettes, what they did with them is not your fault." OR "It was supposed to be a near death experience.
2,2,0,I know you did it, they know you did it, but for know just play it cool.
4,0,0,This looks tough. Do you have any character witnesses we could call?
3,1,0,Being under Texas law, you can look forward to...well...yourself.
4,0,0,I'm here for you. This is Texas!
3,1,0,This is a contract case--we can't ask for the death penalty.
4,0,0,What do you mean this is my last trial?
3,0,0,Honestly, he was dead when I got here.
4,0,0,I get a splitting headache if I don't have my coffee.
4,0,0,"It's my job" is not a defense.
2,2,0,actually, I was thinking we should wait until I have presented my final argument.
2,1,1,So, you're claiming the guy was dead when you got there?
3,1,0,It's a complicated trial, but I suspect you'll walk away unscythed.
3,0,0,Whatever you do, don't bring out your scythe.
2,1,1,On second thought, I really don't think it's a great idea to call Taxes as a character witness.
4,0,0,I know Mr. Reaper, but I don't think you should remind the jury that everyone dies.
4,0,0,Remember, try not to over-react.
3,0,0,I think we should ask for life.
4,0,0,I don't like to reschedule on my plastic surgeon. It's rude.
3,1,0,Your ex may have taken you to the cleaners, but she can't have your soul.
2,2,0,If you're just tapping people on the shoulder... I think we can get you off on a technicality.
2,2,0,We lucked out. The judge is dead.
4,0,0,I said dress appropriately... You have killer written all over you!
4,0,0,They think you are a serial killer.
4,0,0,My client has a great alibi. That night Irene died, he was at Heather's place. And Gertrud's place. And John's...
3,1,0,"No, a hung jury does not mean your hangman buddy is involved in this case".
4,0,0,Think of it this way, encountering juror bias is not unusual, but simply a matter of degree. In some cases, like yours, it just seems to be a tad more pronounced.
3,0,1,They can see the guilt on your face."
3,1,0,No, there is no pleading the Sith...
2,1,0,Don't worry, life is still on the table
4,0,0,Why yes, it is a death penalty case but what do you care?
3,0,1,I think I can get them to take death off the table.
2,2,0,This is New York; they abolished the death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm sorry. The dead man's rule just doesn't apply here.
3,0,1,No, Grim, I told you - you're just a humble farmer. The sickle had beat juice on it.
2,2,0,Not to worry. They don't call him the hanging judge for nothing.
4,0,0,This is the IRS hearing. The Equifax meeting is next week, Mr. Ghost.
2,2,0,I'll let you do the closing argument.
1,1,2,Remember, you were only doing your job.
1,1,1,Don't say anything about your plans for tonight.
3,1,0,...and you are?
4,0,0,I hate to be the grim reaper, but your case is not looking good.
3,1,0,Should I offer them to settle this over a game of chess?
4,0,0,Plead the 5th amendment.
3,0,1,If the scythe does not fit, you must acquit!
2,0,1,Good news. It's the death penalty.
3,1,0,To this jury, you're not death incarnate, you're just a white guy with a hoodie - you'll be fine.
3,1,0,It would be good if you smiled more.
3,1,0,Try to avoid eye contact with the jury.
2,2,0,In this case, the death penalty is not a good thing.
4,0,0,“Don’t fall for the old ‘Where were you on the night of the murder?’ trick”.
4,0,0,Look, you're staring death in the face here.
1,2,1,So the deal is I'll get you probation if you give me another 60 years. And you do something about my mother-in-law.
4,0,0,Are you the court-appointed attorney?
3,1,0,I don't think wearing a conservative suit and tie would have killed you… You know what I mean.
4,0,0,Try to keep a straight face.
4,0,0,The bailiff warned us that the judge thinks you're trying to intimidate him, Mr. Reaper.
1,1,1,About my bill, I prefer cash.
4,0,0,The prosecution is going for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Wear gloves when you place your hand on the bible.
3,0,0,With a plea deal, we should be able to avoid the You penalty.
3,1,0,It's going to be hard to get a fair jury in Miami
4,0,0,As for my expenses ... I can make a deal with you.
3,0,0,It looks good for an acquittal. The prosecutor can't find any witness who saw the perpetrator's face.
3,1,0,No I can assure you guilt was not written all over his face.
4,0,0,You can't refuse to incriminate yourself if you don't have a self to incriminate.
1,2,1,Your failure to appear isn't helping.
3,1,0,Death penalty? Who do they think they're kidding?
3,1,0,You are making my defense work of you seem hollow
3,1,0,Look straight ahead and don't worry about any eyewitnesses.
4,0,0,Hard to believe this is your first trial.
1,2,1,You can't avoid taxes.
3,1,0,They offered you a life sentence
3,0,1,Well, at least we can be assured that Capital Punishment is off the table.
2,2,0,If the jury comes back with the life penalty, we'll appeal it.
4,0,0,You want to put the death penalty "on" the table?
2,2,0,What exactly do you mean, "bored to death"?
3,1,0,The jugge just reminded us that no hoodies are allowed in the courtroom.
2,0,2,I take it the prospect of a life sentence doesn't phase you.
4,0,0,Twenty to life -- take it.
2,2,0,Remember, you were just doing your job.
4,0,0,No, even the faceless have to remove their hoods.
4,0,0,Jag tror som gick mycket bra !
4,0,0,You've killed how many?
1,1,1,You "kindly stopped" for her? What does that even mean?
3,0,1,It'd really help if you stopped dressing like that.
2,1,1,The word is he's a hanging judge.
1,2,0,Well, for you, it's not so much a penalty.
4,0,0,It's grimmer than we thought.
2,2,0,I haven't seen you since the tobacco trial, how the kids?
3,1,0,We're okay. The Court has confirmed the right to bear scythes.
4,0,0,Look into my eyes and tell me the truth!
4,0,0,You can't give up now. My wife just took out a million-dollar life insurance policy.
4,0,0,The jurors with the 'Make American Great" buttons seem the most sympathetic.
2,1,0,It looks pretty grim, but there might be a bright light at the end of the tunnel.
4,0,0,Breach of contract?! I was the one who was cheated!
4,0,0,Don't worry about saving face when you testify.
3,1,0,I don't think they will identify you...
0,2,1,What do you mean you're confident it will be a hung jury?
4,0,0,I told you, I got a very good feeling about this. I mean, you look just like death warmed over.
3,1,0,The defense: You are a head case.
3,1,0,What was that other thing besides taxes?
4,0,0,I don't think you have to worry, they have taken the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Jumping the gun a little, aren't you?
3,1,0,Try to be less foreboding.
1,3,0,In a word, grim.
4,0,0,Hey! Lighten up, it's just a cartoon.
3,0,1,OK, with the next witness, please say "I'll see you later" with a bit less enthusiasm.
4,0,0,I'm not sure that this judge will consider a voice message a binding contract that you won a free Caribbean Cruise.
4,0,0,No, I don't think more cowbell will mitigate the public's fear of you.
3,0,0,OK, you want me to argue that it's cruel and unusual punishment, to avoid the life penalty.
3,1,0,I'm sorry to inform you that you've been given the life penalty.
2,1,1,I have to be honest, it's looking pretty grim.
2,2,0,Bad news, there's no death penalty in this state.
2,2,0,Finding a jury of your peers is terrifying.
2,2,0,The worst you could get is Life
3,1,0,Maybe dress more liberally for the sentencing hearing.
3,0,0,Law school did not prepare me for this.
4,0,0,Gross negligence to deliver a timely death is a slap on the wrist. You're looking at 6 months, minus Eternity already served..
4,0,0,Would it kill you to lose the hoodie?
2,1,1,Try to maintain eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,Now don't forget. If we overcome the optics you have a shot at getting away with murder.
4,0,0,I can't promise that you won't get life
1,2,1,I thought I advised you not to wear your hoodie.
1,3,0,If worse comes to worst, you could get life.
3,0,1,Trust me! If the court can turn a corporation into a person, it can turn you into one, too.
4,0,0,My intent is to persuade the jury that you're not mighty and dreadful at all, but rather a slave to fate, chance, kings, et alii.
3,0,0,You could get life. It's unfortunate, but you have to appreciate the irony
0,1,2,Bad news. Famine just turned state's witness.
3,1,0,Ok, we're going to introduce you as an 'expert witness' in your field....
3,1,0,I hope you don't think I'm doing this pro bono just to get on your good side?
3,0,0,With the plea bargain I can get you life.
4,0,0,Good lord, that's a terrible alibi.
3,1,0,The death penalty would be too ironic.
3,1,0,Don't mention the scythe.
4,0,0,Sorry, but i think the Judge will find you lack testamentary capacity.
4,0,0,I advise you to plead guilty but with an explanation.
2,2,0,The governor is willing to grant you clemecy if you agree to visit Bernie first thing.
4,0,0,Ok, so we agree that our strategy is to get the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,It's probably best if you don't point your scythe at jurors and say "you're next."
4,0,0,You're going to have to face facts!
1,1,0,There is no need to use your alias, I think the jurors will recognize you.
3,1,0,It's uncanny! He had no difficulty picking you out in the line-up.
4,0,0,Let me do the talking and don't make eye contact with the judge--he'll see right through you.
2,1,0,You've got to show them you're not just an empty robe.
3,0,1,My recommendation is to take the three souls.
2,1,1,When I asked about your taxes you said you were certain.
4,0,0,The court won't accept the name "Grim Reaper.
3,1,0,At least I have a lawyer.
4,0,0,Reaper, you can have your scythe back after court.
3,1,0,Where's your tie?
3,1,0,Luckily this jury is as pro death as they come.
3,0,0,That necktie makes you look too sinister.
2,0,1,Could you have at least worn a tie?
2,1,0,You've been through how many attorneys??
3,1,0,As co-counsel, I insist we seek the death penalty.
4,0,0,We'll use that population-control argument if we have to. But first, let's try to scare off a few witnesses.
3,1,0,I told you to wear a tie - you look a little intimidating.
3,1,0,You have to face the facts.
3,0,1,You need to take the next witness.
4,0,0,What do you mean you're afraid of the death penalty?
4,0,0,We all have a job to do,
3,1,0,Lawyer fees are eternal
3,1,0,The scythe may send the wrong message.
2,2,0,When you told me you wanted to file for divorce, I didn't realize she literally sucked the life out of you.
3,0,0,If this is your idea of "saving face" then yes, I'd say the outlook's pretty Grim.
4,0,0,Ever wonder why some people are in the wrong place at the wrong time?
4,0,0,Don't worry. Time is on our side.
3,1,0,The death penalty is on the table?
3,0,1,Conscience, can we talk later?
3,1,0,If he asks about the hood, tell him you have very sensitive skin.
2,2,0,The verdict is looking grim.
4,0,0,You could be looking at a life sentence...
3,1,0,They'll knock it down to 100 billion counts of voluntary manslaughter.
4,0,0,Well, he is known as "The Hanging Judge".
2,1,1,A guilty plea will get you life.
4,0,0,We might have some trouble explaining the scythe found at the scene of the crime.
4,0,0,How many times do I have to tell you, taxes also!
2,2,0,I'm afraid you'll have to agree to pay child support. Your wife appears to have no fear of death.
4,0,0,I'll take the fifth on that and anyone who disagrees.
4,0,0,No, you can't request the death penalty as damages in a civil trial.
3,0,1,Yes, this is a death penalty jurisdiction.
4,0,0,Now that's how you present a case. It was a good day for the law firm of O'Malley, Goldstein & Reaper.
3,1,0,They'll think your guilty if you look so grim.
3,0,1,Counsel. Explain to me please how "Life plus 25 " works again.
3,1,0,You realize, if this goes badly, you may get life.
2,1,0,It might seem black and white to you, but the judge will never go for no chess players on the jury.
1,2,1,Good news. Charges are being dropped for all crimes that took place before the 15th century.
3,1,0,At least I have a nose.
4,0,0,I agree, the jury's lack of eye contact is worrisome.
4,0,0,Legally, I don't see a way out of this.
3,1,0,It's about the hoodie.
3,0,1,'So...any good news !"
2,2,0,I'm sorry, but "somebody has to do it" is not a viable defense.
4,0,0,the good news is that you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,Its a pretty big list. Can't you just pick out the famous ones?
2,1,1,I'm assuming no appeal if you're sentenced to death!
4,0,0,I thought I told you to try and "Blend" for the Line Up.
2,2,0,Your request for a chess match has been denied.
2,1,1,Go with me here. What's the worst that can happen?
4,0,0,And you're absolutely positive it was Bill Cosby?
2,1,1,So when you get up there this time, try not to look so grim.
3,1,0,I don't suppose we'll be able to find any character witnesses.
2,2,0,We're short on character witnesses.
3,1,0,The verdict is self-imposed punishment.
4,0,0,... And as your attorney, I still have to advise you against "pleading the scythe."
4,0,0,I'm doing this work pro malus.
3,0,1,Well, in your case, it is kind of a win-win.
2,1,0,And remember don't say anything until I ask you to explain why Frank isn't here.
4,0,0,Now remember, you're in "Resource Management".
3,1,0,You need to get your head in this trial...
2,2,0,Unfortunately, the absence of prints on the scythe actually works against you.
4,0,0,I think it will be difficult to argue that this is a prima facie case.
2,1,1,I don't think anyone has ever plea bargained FOR the death penalty.
4,0,0,Is it hot in here, or is it me?
2,1,0,I _believe_ it's an Eddie Bauer cloak, but -
4,0,0,it does not matter how you cloak it
3,1,0,So I told her, 'Come on babe, live every moment like it's your last.'
0,4,0,My fee is negotiable.
4,0,0,Don't worry. No one saw your face.
4,0,0,We're going to be a caption for another lawyer joke.
3,0,0,I guess we don't have to worry about the death penalty.
3,0,0,Just wait for the appeals process. It's a killer.
4,0,0,I think our best bet is to plead down to justifiable homicide.
3,1,0,As your attorney, I advise you to keep the hood on.
4,0,0,The "Force" is with you...
4,0,0,Bad news. The prosecutor isn't seeking the death penalty for you.
2,1,0,"Remember, don't smile"!
4,0,0,Candidly, your case is looking grim.
3,1,0,Hey, what are some good chillwave bands bro?
4,0,0,Sorry, but you don't stand a ghost of a chance with this jury.
2,1,1,Take the deal. It's only two days in heaven.
3,0,0,Stop staring at the jury -- there are no more alternates.
4,0,0,I think we have a hell-a-va defense here.
4,0,0,I don't think 'but that's what I do' is going to fly with the jury
4,0,0,Death be not your name?
4,0,0,I'm sorry but you have to admit it's a little amusing that it's called the death penalty.
2,1,0,We will fight this to death!
3,1,0,Don't worry. The numbers are on your side.
2,1,0,I hate to tell you this, but things are looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,I don't want to worry you, but they're seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,The charge will be reduced to manslaughter if we can prove it was an accident.
3,1,0,Oh man, you smell like... forget it.
3,1,0,I don't believe I can argue against the death penalty, all things considered.
3,1,0,Yes, there is a chance that it'll be a hung jury.
4,0,0,Too bad, but since you're already dead, they can't give you life.
4,0,0,No. You don't get the sickle back. It is evidence now.
4,0,0,Perfect! And I'll handle the tax issues.
3,0,1,They found taxes inevitable, so we have a good chance.
2,2,0,I don't think 'just doing my job' is a sound defense in this case.
4,0,0,My guess is that his first ploy will be to ask for a postponement.
4,0,0,Put yourself on the stand and it will come back to haunt you.
2,2,0,The judge wants to know where you got the robe with the hoodie.
3,0,0,How many victims ?
4,0,0,Your mouthwash ain't cuttin it!
3,1,0,On the bright side, you'll feel right at home on death row.
4,0,0,Can you face the judge? I'm getting echo.
3,1,0,It's going to be up to the jurors to determine if the hood fits.
3,0,1,The jury needs to see your lighter side.
3,1,0,I'm sorry. There's no open carry defense for a scythe.
1,2,1,So, what happened to your last attorney?
3,0,1,I really don't think we should use Satan as a witness.
2,2,0,I know it's Halloween, but no one is presuming you innocent at this point.
2,2,0,The jury sent out a note asking what the death penalty would mean in your case.
3,1,0,I don't think a change of venue will help.
3,0,0,Your homeowners won't cover my fees.
2,0,0,...and stop staring at the jury. It's intimidating.
3,0,1,If you testify you're dead.
4,0,0,I really wish you had followed my advice and worn a suit.
3,1,0,Well, your alibis' not being able to show up does create a bit of a problem.
1,2,1,Bad news! The state has just abolished the death penalty.
3,1,0,You might have a better chance if you took off that hoody.
3,1,0,Calling you "He-who-must-not-be-named" might weaken your defense.
3,0,1,I'll plead guilty by death through me
2,1,1,The prosecution is looking for a life sentence, I think we can get you death.
3,0,1,It's not looking good. Throw a kiss to Juror #6.
4,0,0,Just to confirm: you are NOT taking the stand.
4,0,0,You didnt tell me you were in the 'hood
4,0,0,How about we make "die trying" the backup plan?
4,0,0,Sorry, it looks like you're getting the death penalty again.
3,0,1,Try to smile
3,0,0,Just as I suspected...it is a capital offense
3,0,0,I think we're OK, they're having trouble establishing a motive
3,1,0,You need to cut a deal. Otherwise it's death without the possibility of parole.
4,0,0,Do me a favor, if the judge decides on the death penalty for you, don't giggle.
4,0,0,We just have to convince the jury you were on holiday.
2,2,0,I hear the jury is pro-life.
4,0,0,It wasn't me.
3,0,0,Remember, without fingerprints, they can't prove anything.
2,1,1,So let me see if I understand you. You want to plea me down to death?
2,2,0,No, death without parole isn't an option.
4,0,0,Relax, this jurisdiction looks very favorably upon whistleblowers
3,1,0,Any idea why your key witness is missing?
2,2,0,I think Habeas Corpus is the best way to go here...
4,0,0,Remember what I told you. You don't know anything about Christmas future, and you've never seen that Scrooge guy before the trial.
1,3,0,Please tell me you didn't hang the jury.
4,0,0,He’s simply here, Your Honor, for a “meet and greet” with the defendant.
4,0,0,No, I don't think a game of chess would help.
3,1,0,Is life good for you?
3,0,0,Better late than never.
1,3,0,Will you stop asking for the death penalty!
4,0,0,Is there anything missing from your testimony?
4,0,0,No, Shkreli does not have a copyright on that sentiment, but I must advise you not to tweet it during the hearing.
2,1,0,I don't think you have much of a chance but at least you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
3,0,0,They found your fingerprints on the scythe next to the body.
3,0,1,Try not to mention anything about your past.
3,0,1,This case will be so famous, they're going to name the penalty after you.
3,0,1,Please stop snickering at "death penalty."
3,1,0,Listen, we all know the Oppenheimer quote. Next time just say, "Not guilty, your honor."
3,1,0,I don't think we can get a continuance for all eternity......
2,1,0,We'll try to get you the death sentence, anything to avoid life.
4,0,0,I think you should drop the lawsuit. They're not going to repeal the helmut law
2,1,0,If "The Devil and Daniel Webster " is any precedent, I have you beat.
2,1,1,It helps that you're active in the community.
3,1,0,Remember, you never touched the guy.
3,0,0,What do you mean - it's a cold case?
4,0,0,Just because I wear hoodie, people assume I'm guilty.
4,0,0,Don't come out unless you hear "summary judgment".
3,0,0,Relax. You're not going to get life.
1,2,1,I think you'll like him, he's a hanging judge.
2,2,0,The problem is mainly the hoodie.
3,0,1,Do you realize how hard it is to be your lawyer?
2,2,0,the good news is no one got a clear look at the suspect's face.
2,2,0,Our best case scenario is that you get the death penalty.
4,0,0,Yes, you can testify on your own behalf. But only as a last resort!
4,0,0,And again, I beg you --Please don't laugh when he grants you a life sentence.
3,1,0,Drop the smirk or you'll be known at the grin reaper.
4,0,0,Well, I guess the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,Relax. This judge has never sentenced someone to the you penalty.
0,3,1,Plead guilty and you'll get life.
3,1,0,Well you tell me. ..You're the expert in the death penalty.
4,0,0,It's a good thing we're not in Texas
4,0,0,Don't tell the judge the pain is gone.
3,1,0,I told you not to wear your hoodie!
4,0,0,They still haven't found the body.
2,0,0,I should point out that in your case, a plea bargain will not help you escape the death penalty.
3,1,0,What do you mean you may have "mixed a few up?"
4,0,0,Two immovable forces finally collide as the IRS audits THE GRIM REAPER.
2,2,0,Look into their eyes, with a confident smile.
3,0,1,I think we should take the plea deal. They've got a pretty strong case
3,0,1,Remember. You're just the messenger -- just doing your job.
3,0,0,This must be serious. You sent a partner instead of an associate.
4,0,0,The judge believes he can try you in absentia.
4,0,0,Stop chuckling every time they mention death.
4,0,0,The prosecutor is going to push for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Your optics need some improvement.
3,1,0,Did you just call me an 'empty suit'?
3,1,0,We are going with "unlawful search and scyther."
3,1,0,I appreciate your efforts but I've decided to represent myself.
4,0,0,I hope the prosecution doesn't try to show that there is a pattern here.
3,1,0,When you're on the stand, try to avoid talking about your work.
2,2,0,How about we try the “misunderstood” reaper?
3,0,0,Relax, imposing the death penalty would be ridiculous.
4,0,0,I wish you'd gone to Brooks Brothers like I'd suggested.
4,0,0,Look, your fingerprints are all over these murders, so the best we can hope for is life.
3,1,0,If all else fails, we'll ask for a writ of Habeus corpse.
3,1,0,Sorry, but I don't think we can ask for the death penalty in a bankruptcy case.
3,1,0,Fat chance. Her Honor leans toward Life without parole.
4,0,0,I hate to tell you this, but you don't have a "chance in hell"of being acquitted.
4,0,0,I think we're in trouble. They're going to call Taxes to the stand.
1,1,1,You keep saying hung jury like it's a good thing.
2,2,0,No, I don't think the hoodie was the problem.
4,0,0,No, what I asked was, Did you, Reaper?; not Did you rape her?
3,0,0,"May I call you 'Grim?'l
4,0,0,Relax, Christmas Past and Present have agreed to testify for you.
3,0,0,What did you say would happen if I don't get a reduction in your alimony?
3,1,0,Life without parole is your best bet
4,0,0,The jury doesn't like you. You need to testify that you blacked out.
1,2,1,I already sold my soul.
4,0,0,I have repeatedly said there is no dress code here!
4,0,0,I can't organize a defense if you keep bugging me about playing chess.
3,1,0,As an expert witness try smiling less.
2,0,1,Please stop shouting "But I've killed EVERYONE"
4,0,0,Death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,As long as you didn't leave any fingerprints, you'd be fine.
4,0,0,Good news, you're eligible for the death penalty.
4,0,0,First listen to my closing argument.
3,0,1,Anybody see you?
1,2,0,It's not the hoodie that worries me.
4,0,0,No, they get to give that penalty too.
3,1,0,I just, I don't know, always imagined you as white
4,0,0,We'll plead not guilty by reason of invisibility.
4,0,0,But you are the final argument.
3,1,0,Well, they're giving you life.
3,1,0,By the way... I have some bad news.
4,0,0,Did you have to wear that?
3,0,0,Death and Tax Evasion.
4,0,0,Donald wants 300 million souls as collateral.
2,0,2,Just remember when the time comes I'm doin this pro bono.
4,0,0,For Chrissakes, stop looking jurors in the eye.
2,1,0,You can testify but you have to lose the scythe and the hoodie.
3,1,0,They're starting to run out of prosecutors.
2,1,1,Have you considered keeping me on retainer?
2,2,0,The court don't have no mercy in this land, either.
3,1,0,Remember, we're trying to highlight your cuddly side
3,0,0,I am worried about the way you are dressed before a conservative judge. He normally rules against men wearing nail polish.
3,1,0,Face it! The case against you is grim.
4,0,0,In my youth "The Invisible Man " was wrapped in bandages!!!!!
3,1,0,Where you get the hoodie?
2,1,0,Only you would wear a hoodie into a courtroom.
4,0,0,I say, cop a plea and go for Eternity with chance of parole.
3,1,0,It looks like you are going to have pay those taxes
2,2,0,"For the 100th time, no, that hoodie does not make you look fat!'
3,0,0,The Grim Reaper defense won't work in your case.
3,0,0,Ironically, you've been given life.
4,0,0,I’m pretty sure the judge will be inclined to split the baby. Literally.
2,1,1,Not now--I'm in the middle of a big case.
4,0,0,The expert witness will be testifying via Skype, not scythe.
2,1,1,No, you can't settle this with a chess match.
0,4,0,I'm going to win this case if it's the last thing I do.
3,1,0,If I’m going to get you off, you have to lose the hoodie.
3,0,0,I knew she never saw my face...my eyes are green not blue
2,1,0,I'm thinking hung jury.
1,3,0,I'll do the talking. You do the pointing.
4,0,0,Not now, I'm busy.
3,1,0,Take the Fifth.
4,0,0,Maybe I should have ordered my anvil to go...
4,0,0,I fired your wardrobe consultant.
4,0,0,Be advised, the pen is mightier than the sickle.
2,2,0,So it's not exactly a jury of your peers...
3,1,0,I'm not saying it's you, but the whole jury died on sentencing day.
1,2,1,No, you do not get to 'help with the hangings' if it's a hung jury.
1,2,0,They found the scythe. We need to cop a plea.
4,0,0,Do you believe in karma?
4,0,0,Are you ready to face the music?
3,0,0,Look buddy, nobody cheats me.
2,2,0,I know you're the executioner - I'm worried about the judge and jury.
4,0,0,Relax, "death penalty" is just a figure of speech.
3,1,0,And no, you won't be testifying in your own defense.
3,0,1,Remind me again - which one of us is the lawyer?
4,0,0,If you were the devil, we could create sympathy.
3,1,0,You're looking at 100 billion counts, but I'm pretty sure I can get the Hitler charge dropped.
4,0,0,Try to show off some bone so the jury can see you're white.
3,1,0,Relax, in your case the death penalty is nothing to worry about.
4,0,0,I can get this dropped to half an eternity, easy.
2,1,1,Reap what you sow
3,1,0,I'm going to assume you're familiar with the death penalty.
4,0,0,You WANT the death sentence?
3,1,0,They're just not going to buy that you were only following orders.
4,0,0,This is the part where the death penalty is considered. As your lawyer, I suggest you consider not addressing the court.
3,1,0,I need to warn you that you could get life.
4,0,0,The jury doesn't care how you're dressed. Demeanor wins cases.
3,1,0,You should of shaved for court day.
3,1,0,It would really help if you lost the hoodie.
4,0,0,No worries! This state has abolished the death penalty
3,1,0,We think that your visitation rights should be limited.
3,0,1,I thought we had a chance until you told the jury, 'I'll get you all someday.'
3,1,0,Your chances for acquittal look really grim.
2,1,0,Lots of guys look like me.
3,0,1,So you'll plead if you can get the death penalty?
4,0,0,I just don't think pleading the 5th is going to work here...
2,2,0,Well at least I can help you save face.
3,1,0,The jury is back and they look grim, Mr. Reaper.
0,2,1,You'll like this; they gave you the death penalty.
3,0,1,I'm afraid the best we can hope for is life.
2,2,0,No, you cannot threaten the jury.
3,1,0,In my defense, you said you preferred not to leave your comfort zone.
4,0,0,Can't you read? I texted you to look broody, gloomy and moody, but NOT to wear a hoodie!
3,1,0,At least try to show remorse.
3,0,0,The judge may perceive the death penalty as a conflict of interest.
1,2,0,Sorry, it's a life sentence.
2,0,1,Can I just plea without the bargain?
3,1,0,Perhaps we should change our tactic, lighten up and don't look so Grimm.......
4,0,0,Going with reasonable doubt. You good with reasonable doubt?
4,0,0,As your atourney, I'm advising you to plead innocent. It's not your fault that people don't get Existentialism!
2,2,0,Try not to look so grim on the stand.
4,0,0,Okay, I understand that but I worked hard to get your conviction thrown out.
2,1,0,When I said our best hope was for a hung jury, I didn't mean it literally.
4,0,0,...has a fool for a client.
4,0,0,I don't think we have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,Given the current field, I do believe you're on solid legal footing.. but, still- I strongly recommend waiting until 2020.
4,0,0,So that's your defense? Because she could not stop for you, you kindly stopped for her?
3,1,0,Remember, we want the jury to like you.
3,1,0,Death be not proud. Let's settle.
3,1,0,I think we should file a petition for habeas corpus.
1,3,0,Your business plan is sound.
4,0,0,Can I testify on my behalf?
4,0,0,Did you not read the - when it's your time - clause in your contract?
3,1,0,What are you pleading? Not guilty or not here?
4,0,0,So you're asking me to convince the jury that your cashmere hoodie is at the cleaners?
4,0,0,For heavens sake MOM, it's only a parking ticket.
4,0,0,You'll have to dump the hoodie if you want to impress this judge.
3,1,0,"Cross my heart and hope to die" isn't going to cut it.
3,1,0,Ah hell, let's put you on the stand. What do we have to lose?
3,1,0,Sorry about the scythe, makes the judge nervous.
4,0,0,If a jury can find O.J. innocent, I'm sure you'll be fine.
3,1,0,The bad news is the judge supports the You Penalty.
1,3,0,I'm thinking this is my last case.
3,1,0,No, the death penalty would be redundant.
4,0,0,We can't use "it's my job" as your defense.
1,2,1,So, how's life?
4,0,0,I'm basing your defense on no proof of intent.
2,2,0,No, Blue Oyster Cult performing "Don't Fear the Reaper" wouldn't qualify as character witness testimony.
4,0,0,This will not be another hollow victory.
2,1,0,Remember what I told you - NO giggling if you get the death penalty
4,0,0,There's a bad echo in here.
4,0,0,Then again, maybe we should have stuck with the jumpsuit.
3,0,0,Your scythe? I don't think arguing the second amendment will work.
2,2,0,You think Juror Six can be gotten to?
4,0,0,You still have to pay your back taxes or it will be death, taxes and incarceration.....no, you can't tell the judge your name is Al Sharpton !
4,0,0,If you want to be acquitted, I suggest you ditch the pride routine.
4,0,0,Do you rather I begin with Milton or Pratchett?
3,1,0,Let's opt for the death penalty. It'll give us grounds for appeal.
2,1,0,I didn't mean 'habeas corpus' quite so literally.
2,1,1,You do realize that you're facing life, right?
4,0,0,Your case is looking grim
4,0,0,Try not to stare at the jury.
3,1,0,You really thought you could get away with tax evasion?
4,0,0,Remember what I told you: You're just God's coroner.
1,1,1,It's wrongful, Death.
4,0,0,hold that thought.
4,0,0,It's not looking good, is it?
3,0,0,Don't worry--without the scythe they have nothing.
4,0,0,Well, yeah, I probably could get a plea deal for manslaughter. But with tens of billions of counts, the sentence would still be quite a kick in the pants.
4,0,0,Well, it's better than yesterday's SS uniform.
3,1,0,Our defence will build on your aura of inevitability.
4,0,0,Oh, just another sentencing to death row. What you really need to get me out of, are those unpaid parking tickets!
3,1,0,Good news, the Prosecution is not seeking the death penalty!
3,1,0,He's known as the hanging judge. So you're good.
3,0,0,I think the death penalty is off the table
4,0,0,Why don't you handle culling the jury pool?
3,1,0,The jury will like you better if you wear a suit and tie
3,1,0,Honestly, I don't think you'll make it. This is the fifth time.
4,0,0,No, I still don't like the providing-a-public-service defense. Just keep killing the judges, okay?
3,0,1,A 'hung jury' isn't what you think it means
3,1,0,If convicted, the penalty is death which, in your case, would be moot.
3,0,1,It's not the killing, it's the blatant age discrimination that's going to be problematic.
4,0,0,If the editor is found guilty for not responding to submissions of cartoons in a timely manner, you can have him.
4,0,0,Okay, John Doe, here we go again.
3,0,0,Of course, you are aware of the what the maximum penalty would be.
4,0,0,Let's pivot to a climate change defense.
2,2,0,Hopefully you can get credit for time served.
3,1,0,How ironic - they're asking for the death penalty.
3,1,0,I think your Facebook profile is going to hurt us.
4,0,0,I don't care that NOW your best friend is Scalia, . . . it won't help us in this case.
4,0,0,The case against Taxes has been severed. It's just you now.
4,0,0,The witness expired on New Year's Eve...'know anything about that?
3,0,1,I just noticed: there's nothing in your black hole.
4,0,0,Hipster coffee under a bridge? The apocalypse has begun.
2,2,0,Just doing your job? Nobody’s gonna buy that one.
2,1,1,No, I won't tell the judge her time is almost up.
4,0,0,We need for you to reap the benefit of the doubt from the jury
3,1,0,He said up the river, not across the river.
4,0,0,All is not lost, just try to stop thinking on the dark side.
3,0,1,Frankly Mr. Zimmerman, I don't see how this helps your case.
3,1,0,Your chances of winning this case are grim.
4,0,0,Let the jury look you straight in the eye.
3,1,0,Try not to look at the jury. Ever.
4,0,0,I can't tell the judge that your name is also your job!
4,0,0,Nice to finally meet you face to hole.
2,2,0,They've dropped the murder charges, but the tax evasion charges stuck.
3,1,0,You really shouldn't threaten the witness like that.
1,2,0,If you want people to believe you're innocent, the hoodie has to go.
4,0,0,Again - You're asking me to ghost-write for you?
1,3,0,Hopefully, this will be my first--and last--near-death experience.
3,0,0,The scythe is protected under free speech and can't be held against you.
4,0,0,She meant literally ""til death do us part?"
3,0,0,At least we have precedent on our side.
3,1,0,Well, one' thing's for sure. We don't have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,Look, the jury knows you're responsible for the deaths of billions. So if I can get a plea deal for reckless endangerment, we should take it.
3,0,0,So, have you heard that new Drake song yet?
4,0,0,Stop asking to shake the prosecutor's hand.
3,1,0,These cases always end the same
4,0,0,We're going to win so for Pete's sake keep your head on !
4,0,0,a few further questions, your honor
4,0,0,What? You really need to borrow my glasses?
3,1,0,I suggest a little fire and brimstone in your closing remarks.
2,2,0,...and try not to look so guilty.
2,0,0,A jury of your peers does't mean they have to be wearing hoodies.
4,0,0,I would prefer to go to hell. My wife is already in heaven
2,2,0,The Prosecutor is asking for a life sentence.
2,2,0,Remember, their fate was determined before you came upon the scene.
4,0,0,It's not going to help to tell them you invented the death sentence.
4,0,0,The best the jury will give you is parole without life.
4,0,0,So, you're certain, that there is no chance for a win on appeal in tax court?
4,0,0,I am worried that the jury may have found your alibi quite hollow.
3,1,0,Bad news - they're offering life.
2,2,0,Nobody avoids taxes.
2,1,1,What's the worst you can get? Life?
4,0,0,It was difficult to find a jury of your peers, but we think the easter bunny will lean in our direction.
4,0,0,You do know they are asking for death?
3,1,0,Gender bias is the least of our problems.
3,0,0,One suggestion: The next time the judge says "Take the witness" - don't.
4,0,0,For God's sake Artie, press your human button and smile. For God's sake Artie, press your human button smile.
4,0,0,[ahem] ...could you repeat that number again? You say that you are responsible for how many deaths?
4,0,0,Don't threaten to smite the jury, it makes you appear less sympathetic
4,0,0,A lawyer can do just so much. You need an image consultant and a stylist.
0,1,2,If only we could stop the next witness from testifying.
4,0,0,So we're sticking with the "Trick or Treat" alibi?
3,1,0,As a demonstration of good faith, they've agreed to take death off of the table if you'll promise to do the same.
4,0,0,No, he didn't mean 'hung jury' literally.
4,0,0,I can't put you on the stand. We both know you killed him.
4,0,0,Tell them I have a right to privacy
3,0,1,Just because that particular sentence is named after you doesn't mean we're doomed from the start.
4,0,0,With luck, you'll get life.
4,0,0,Don’t worry – just last week I got Pestilence off on a misdemeanor.
4,0,0,You know, that hoodie isn't gonna work the jury.
1,2,1,There's no easy way to say this but you've got terrible breath.
4,0,0,Just don't look the jury in the eye.
2,1,1,Please try to cut back on the ominous pointing today.
4,0,0,No Justice Scalia, you can not vote on this one.
3,1,0,It's OK, smiling at the jury is overrated, anyway.
3,0,0,Don't worry, World War II is past the statute of limitation.
4,0,0,They're obviously going to have a tough time implementing capital punishment without your cooperation, but there's no getting around the fact that you really have taken a lot of lives.
3,0,0,Think of it as a vacation, and rest up for all the extra work you'll have waiting for you when you get back.
2,0,1,"He Who Must Not Be Named" won't fly.
2,2,0,I'm sorry, but it looks like you'll be sentenced to Life.
3,1,0,Don't worry, they've abolished the death penalty.
2,2,0,I'd prefer a hung jury.
4,0,0,What's the worst that could happen, a death sentence?
3,1,0,If you cop to the first billion counts, I might be able to get your sentence reduced.
3,0,0,I told you not to wear a hoodie in that neighborhood.
4,0,0,What's the worst that could happen, the death penalty?
3,1,0,So far, the "intimidating the witness" strategy seems to be working.
4,0,0,Look, I'm your attorney. Your scythe will be safe in my office...you've got to trust me. Oh, and keep the hood on. Trust, remember? I've been around the block a few times on account of you.
2,1,1,Fortunately this state doesn't have a you penalty.
3,1,0,No, that's not what I meant by "the jury is deadlocked."
4,0,0,They have no case, it is all circumstantial evidence.
2,1,1,I can't defend you if you keep killing the prosecutors.
4,0,0,Naw, trust me on this one - let's leave your sickle in the car.
3,1,0,The judge is threatening to impose the life penalty.
2,1,1,I might be able to get you life.
4,0,0,Well, if it's any consolation, he can't take it with him.
2,2,0,Charlie, most people who plead not-guilty wear suits.
4,0,0,As a personal favor to me, I have this ex that is a real pain. If you know what I mean.
3,0,1,I've heard of jury nullification, but this is ridiculous.
4,0,0,I didn't realize Hell had a law school.
3,1,0,So what part of 'my client has nothing to hide' didn't you understand?
2,2,0,We probably can't argue mistaken identity.
3,1,0,Try to present a bright picture of yourself.
4,0,0,Tell them you're not only representing yourself, you're your own sentence as well.
4,0,0,I said it was best to look grim during a homicide defense, not look like the grim reaper.
3,0,0,It is hard enough, did you have to wear that to court
2,1,1,It's been difficult to find a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,I thought we agreed on a navy suit.
4,0,0,I can't believe the outcome of this case is a life or death matter for you.
3,1,0,Relax, there is no Life penalty in Texas.
3,1,0,We'll plead down to mankindslaughter.
3,0,1,Just try not to look guilty.
4,0,0,No, it won't help to pay each of the jurors a visit.
2,1,1,No, we can't seek the death penalty on a parking violation.
3,1,0,There's a hole in your story.
4,0,0,So - you'd be okay with a life sentence, right?
3,1,0,Don't interrupt me, I'm killing it.
2,1,0,But you told me the most the judge could give me was life!
4,0,0,Off the record, does that come in a pinstripe?
4,0,0,Your case is looking good, because the witnesses are having problems identifying you!
4,0,0,The judge doesn't think you have sufficient grounds for habeas corpus since the court is not holding your body in custody.
3,0,0,Trust me: You'll kill up there.
3,1,0,I am pretty sure the prosector's facial recognition software is not that good.
3,1,0,Personally, I'm against it.
4,0,0,No, I don't think changing your name now will help, Mr.Axe Murderer!
4,0,0,No, a life sentence does not mean that you're exempt.
2,1,0,According to the statute of limitations, you're already dead.
4,0,0,You've got to stop saying 'All Deaths Matter.'
4,0,0,I'm having second thoughts on our defense strategy as far as swapping clothing.
4,0,0,Some help, offering to do the jurors' taxes.
3,1,0,The death penalty is not usually considered a reward here.
3,1,0,I think you should be quiet and take the deal, if convicted you will get natural life plus ten years, that could be an eternity in your case!!
4,0,0,This is why it's so hard to come for a lawyer.
2,1,0,Without a corpus in your habeas, we better plead guilty.
4,0,0,So much for a deconstructed martini!
4,0,0,She never said anything about a prenup.
4,0,0,I'm afraid that your case looks rather grim.
3,1,0,Do your prefer Grim or Mr. Reaper.
1,2,0,We are merely going to suggest that the scythe could have been planted at the scene.
4,0,0,Mr. President Elect, The 2014 IRS audit has just started.
3,1,0,I told you to put on a suit and tie and get a haircut. What's up with this?
1,3,0,Look, we're in lower Manhattan-it'll be a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,You did "what" with the pitch fork?
3,1,0,I suggest you plead the Fifth Circle of Hell.
1,2,1,No, you don't need to appear before the Court.
3,1,0,Remember, make eye contact with the jury and smile.
4,0,0,Death Lives Matter!
2,2,0,Really, what you do is indefensible, but I'll try.
4,0,0,I think you are a little premature.
3,1,0,They found a scythe at the scene.
3,1,0,I'm afraid your DNA results are not encouraging.
1,3,0,Please, please, please, if he mentions "The Death Sentence," try not to laugh.
1,3,0,It was hard to find a jury of your peers.
2,2,0,I'm not sure the death and taxes argument constitutes reasonable doubt.
3,1,0,That's not what they mean by 'transparency'.
1,2,1,No, you may not "take out" Juror #7.
4,0,0,I don't care what Shakespeare meant, stop saying 'the first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.'
1,2,1,When I said 'Business Attire', I should've been clearer
3,1,0,When I took your case I said be transparent, not invisible!
4,0,0,now remember-just say ooooooh or eeeeee
4,0,0,Remember, don't let them bait you on your involvement with the tobacco industry.
1,1,2,Just say you manage retirement plans.
4,0,0,We're gonna go with the 'sugar-eviscerates-your-soul' defense.
3,0,1,The jury isn't buying it -- cheating death just isn't a crime
4,0,0,I'm afraid that this state has abolished the death penalty.
4,0,0,Try not to sneeze. It only annoys the jurors.
3,1,0,Try not to have such a blank face.
2,1,1,So it's true. You do reap what you sow.
3,1,0,They've taken death off the table.
4,0,0,So, you've decided to plead guilty with an explanation?
3,0,0,You're the typical wrongful death attorney.
4,0,0,you say you had experience in high crime cases !
4,0,0,I don't think 'monkish folderol' will be an effective defense.
4,0,0,No, having drinks with Freddy Krueger would not be a good alibi.
2,1,1,Let's keep the death penalty on the table.
3,1,0,I don't think it is a defense that you were just doing your job.
4,0,0,They'd settle for eighty years, with no dementia.
4,0,0,I see you're wearing an American Giant hoodie... waited six months for mine but it was definitely worth it...fantastic product, don't you think?
0,2,2,Try to look innocent.
3,0,1,I am not laughing in your face
4,0,0,Hung jury, not hanged jury.
4,0,0,The judge thinks it is a hollow argument
3,0,1,Be prepared for the worst, the judge's goldfish died yesterday.
4,0,0,Sorry, but being withdrawn and feeling invisible are indefensible!
3,1,0,I'm afraid the worst option has your name on it.
2,1,1,If you insist on testifying on your own behalf, downplay the grim thing and talk up the reaping.
4,0,0,They are going to ask you why the email server was in your basement.
4,0,0,I really think that holding onto your scythe would give the jury the wrong idea.
4,0,0,This is the first time anyone has tried the "necessary evil" defense, so we'll see how it goes.
3,1,0,You will need to explain why the death rate is still one each.
3,1,0,Guilty until proven innocent, in your case.
3,1,0,Yes, it would be ironic if you got the death penalty.
4,0,0,The judge doesn't agree with your statute of repose argument.
2,1,0,Remember, eye contact the jurors (particularly the ladies) and project a light hearted Joie de vivre.
2,0,1,Well, when you think about, the death penalty is not all that bad for you really.
3,1,0,You're early. Sentencing is tomorrow.
4,0,0,No, pessimism will not win your freedom!
3,0,0,Don't worry. We'll file an appeal.
4,0,0,This will not be that long a trial!
2,2,0,You've got a bit of an image problem.
3,0,0,I'm not sure that taking the stand will help get the jury's sympathy.
2,0,1,I told you to wear a sweater vest.
2,0,1,Don't tell the judge you knew his mother.
3,1,0,He was already dead when you got there?
2,1,1,We're going to ask that your prior record be ruled inadmissible.
3,1,0,Attorney, too? Judge, jury, and executioner weren't enough?
2,2,0,It's a class action on behalf of...it says here...everyone ever.
3,1,0,It's important that you don't laugh when they mention the death penalty.
4,0,0,Black lives matter!!!
3,1,0,Look, I'll try for appeal, but they've got you on 55 million murder charges for last year alone.
4,0,0,Relax, all the jurors are death-qualified.
3,0,1,Sorry, but this is the front row. Your seat's in death row.
2,1,0,They'll give you back your scythe if you promise you won't take anyone away with you.
4,0,0,When this is all over could you do me a favor?
4,0,0,We can only look like people right now.
3,0,0,I think they're going to seek the Death penalty.
3,0,1,If they ask about Scalia, plead the Fifth.
1,2,1,I've got to be honest...your case is looking grim.
4,0,0,Lets see how do I put this,I think the jury finds you off putting
3,1,0,Let's go with "If the shroud don't fit, you must acquit."
3,0,1,Can you hear me now?
2,1,1,I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but couldn't you have worn a suit?
3,0,1,It doesn't look good. The judge was a huge David Bowie fan.
4,0,0,I say we go for one count of hospice.
2,2,0,Geez, are you that afraid to face the jury!
4,0,0,A suit maybe would be nice. You couldn't afford a suit?
4,0,0,So - you're saying Ingmar Bergman can vouch that you were on the beach on the day in question?
3,0,1,Are you sure? Most of my clients try to avoid the death penalty.
4,0,0,What? You're not certain about your taxes?
4,0,0,Relax. The evidence will prove he can't get out of your contract by knocking over the chess board.
3,0,0,I think we should plead insanity
3,1,0,I wasn't able to locate any of your alibis.
2,1,1,When you argue for the death penalty, try to sound impartial.
4,0,0,Don't smile at the jury
3,1,0,Yes, I know, but the prospect of global overcrowding is unlikely to get you a favorable verdict.
2,1,0,We might avoid the death penalty if you plead guilty to tax evasion.
4,0,0,No, the death penalty is not off the table.
1,1,0,I thought I told you to put on a suit and tie.
3,0,0,Now I know that nothing is as certain as tax evasion
4,0,0,We're changing your name.
4,0,0,They're offering thirty-to-life.
4,0,0,H. G. Wells would be proud.
4,0,0,The outcome of this case might have been in your favor, had you just worn the blue suit.
3,1,0,You can't be serious!..
2,2,0,I told you not to wear the hoodie.
3,1,0,Good news. The jury is deadlocked.
4,0,0,Your walk,voice an lack of features are compelling evidence.
4,0,0,I'm sorry but I've got some grim news in regards to your case.
3,1,0,Your breath smells like death.
4,0,0,A tie might sway a few jurors.
1,3,0,You're facing life.
2,2,0,She'll return your scythe in exchange for her The Walking Dead DVDs.
4,0,0,Even without a hung jury, we'll probably still win.
4,0,0,I just think the death penalty is too controversial.
3,1,0,They'll have a hard time convicting without a scythe.
4,0,0,The trial consultant's analysis should shed some light on the jury's reaction to your signature "hoodie" look
3,0,1,You're lucky, he's a hanging judge.
3,0,0,We're okay; scythe open-carry is legal in this state.
4,0,0,This is not my doorstep.
3,1,0,"sure, but I don't think self defense is on the table".
4,0,0,You're not-guilty-self is going to be much more helpful here.
4,0,0,My fee is a soul
3,1,0,No, no, you still have your mojo without your scythe.
3,1,0,We're *this* close to a mistrial, Dave... can you dial it down a notch?
4,0,0,This could be the last death penalty of the court.
4,0,0,I told you not to wear a hoodie to court.
4,0,0,The problem is I don't think saying"I was only doing my job" is going to elicit much sympathy from the jury.
3,1,0,Well, it's the hollow cave face that seems to bother him most. Else, it's the bailiff in about 20 seconds.
3,1,0,This time, don't touch anyone during the reënactment.
2,1,1,Should I bill your corporate or personal account?
3,0,1,Keep in mind that you did kill, well, everyone ever.
1,2,1,Well, what kind of penalty did you expect?
2,2,0,I told you the metal detectors might get your sickle.
4,0,0,Silent Yes , Invisible No
3,1,0,And this train that keeps hitting us... how does it make you feel?
4,0,0,We need to soften your look, it's killing our case.
2,2,0,Make it look like the sickle doesn't fit.
4,0,0,They're probably going to ask for the death sentence.
2,2,0,I understand that you were just doing your job, but 'prior bad acts' are admissable.
3,0,0,So much? And I thought my last lawyer's retainer was high.
4,0,0,Is the death penalty fine with you?
4,0,0,Best-case scenario? The death penalty.
4,0,0,I told you there would be Grim Reapercussions!
2,1,0,Litigious society, agreed. But there Is significant exposure here. Scrooge's Defamation of Character claim will be a challenge.
4,0,0,"This is not going well".
3,0,0,You're correct. As Death the death penalty presents a meta-defense problem.
4,0,0,I have good news. The worst punishment going to hell.
4,0,0,I think I can plea this down to 1,000,0000,0000,000 years.
4,0,0,No. No. No. I want it as much as you do, but there's no way we can ask for the death penalty in the Trump University case.
4,0,0,The good news is that, technically, you can't get the death penalty.
3,1,0,And why, exactly, should we appeal the death penalty?
4,0,0,Keep it on, they won’t look at you as a terrorist.
3,1,0,The problem is that not everyone appreciates your sense of humor.
4,0,0,You have no peers.
4,0,0,So...you were homeless in Hollywood after college!?! What ever happend to your fiance? (Reaper) I think you KNOW what happened to her, don't you...that's why i'm here. So GO TO HELL @#$%&*!?!
3,1,0,In this case nothing can be said to be certain, except death and possibly taxes
3,1,0,Let's face it....your going down.
4,0,0,There's not a soul in this place willing to testify on your behalf.
3,1,0,Sure they took it. You could seriously hurt somebody with that thing!
3,1,0,Trust me, you want to keep the hoodie on.
3,1,0,Remember, we're claiming everything from the hardware as a work expense - not just the scythe.
4,0,0,No. They're not sentencing you to "just be yourself."
2,1,0,You're going to have to stop saying, "No lives matter".
4,0,0,This is going to be about reasonable doubt -NEVER take off the hood.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, but I don't think there is any way you can avoid the death penalty.
4,0,0,No need to look so grim. But if I were you, I'd ditch the hoody and be not proud.
4,0,0,I'm going to petition for more jury challenges.
4,0,0,It doesn't matter if it's ten lifetimes, you can wait.
2,2,0,Come on are you going to follow me everywhere. O.k. I've learned my lesson, texting and driving are bad.
3,1,0,I want to remind you that I am not being paid on the contingency that you are found innocent
2,2,0,No, I do not think the other lawyer's nickname is scarier than yours.
3,0,1,If you testify, they can ask about your prior record -- is that ok?
3,1,0,The jury will never accept a plea of 'You could be next.'
3,0,1,It's all circumstantial. They can't PROVE it was your scythe.
4,0,0,I guarantee, nobody saw my face.
3,1,0,I'm going to firmly assert, "If the hoodie doesn't fit, you must acquit!"
4,0,0,I'm absolutely here for you.
3,0,0,Okay, you know you're supposed to plead the Fifth, right?
3,1,0,I'd like to save you until the end.
1,2,1,"He knew I was coming for him," is not a defense.
3,1,0,Strange how we keep getting hung jurors.
3,0,1,Looks like it's life for you.
2,1,0,As your lawyer, I'm advising you, don't take the stand. Didn't you see the OJ movie?
4,0,0,Darn it, I really shouldn't have jaywalked.
3,1,0,Ironically, the prosecution is seeking the death penalty too
4,0,0,How can you plea the 5th when you don't even have a face?
4,0,0,Listen, the jury will side with the police if you insist on the hoodie.
3,0,0,The trial ahead is looking Grim.
3,0,0,Were down to the heart and soul of the trial.
4,0,0,A white robe would look better in the witness box.
4,0,0,Your being here today will assure they can NOT positively identify you.
4,0,0,I'll be honest with you, things are looking pretty grim.
2,0,2,The judge has disappeared. Anything you want to tell me?
4,0,0,"I tolled the wrong bell" is NOT a good defense.
3,1,0,You're the one that went with the Public Defender.
4,0,0,I'm afraid the prosecution is seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,It says here, 'Turn to Seventh Seal.' What's a Seventh Seal?
2,2,0,Because War, Pestilence and Famine took the dang plea deal, that's why not.
3,0,0,Is this a higher or a lower court?
4,0,0,Just to let you know, the judge is giving you the evil eye.
3,1,0,Sorry, forgeting to recycle isn't a capital offense yet.
2,2,0,Mr. Death, as your counsel I STRONGLY urge you to plead the fifth.
3,1,0,Faceless or not, cyber crime is still a crime. I'd suggest we plea out and save your neck.
4,0,0,Don't worry. I selected jurors with teenagers who look just like you.
4,0,0,If you don't lose the hood, people will take grim part seriously.
3,1,0,They have 100,000 years of evidence...Our chances look grim..
3,1,0,"it's my job" is not a defense to a charge of murder.
3,0,1,I think that you are carrying this "Hoodie" look a little to far.
4,0,0,As your attorney, pleading the Grim Reaper defense will not work in Salem.
2,2,0,Will you please stop saying you're OK with the death penalty?
4,0,0,No guarantees, but I'm pretty sure I can get you 20 to death.
3,0,0,I don't care if it's your job-you have to show some remorse.
4,0,0,Bad news. Their attorney is Daniel Webster.
2,1,0,That's right -- the defense RESTS.
4,0,0,You're my father?
2,2,0,I would really advise against the 'it was his time anyway' defense.
3,1,0,Frankly, I think you should accept the plea bargain and opt for life.
3,1,0,Don't let them hoodwink you into the truth. Die with the lie.
2,1,1,What are your thoughts on the death penalty?
3,0,1,Death and taxes, I'm sure you've heard the expression before.
1,2,0,Look if we lose it's not going to kill you.
3,0,1,Sure, they're pursuing the death penalty. But frankly, I don't see how they're going to follow through.
3,0,1,Don't worry, we'll get you an orange hood
3,1,0,This is serious. You could be facing the you penalty.
3,1,0,I won't lie to you but it's looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,No, taking the stand now won't really help.
4,0,0,Your complexion is sallow. Get more fresh air and exercise.
3,0,0,Remember, your name is G. Sheldon Reaper
3,1,0,Maybe a suit and tie tomorrow.
3,1,0,Just one juror not on your list, and we are home free.
4,0,0,Forget the Jury. I'll talk them to death.
3,1,0,Look, it was a politician. You did us all a favor.
2,1,0,We'll plead "certain."
3,0,0,OJ Simpson?
3,1,0,I believe the case with is going well and would advise you not to testify.
2,1,0,Ironic, but it appears you will have to pay taxes.
2,1,1,They're offering you life, but we can probably talk them up from there.
4,0,0,No, his last name is Issa, not Torquemada.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, it's within the judge’s power to hang the hangman.
4,0,0,Where on earth did you get that fantastic hoodie?
2,1,0,Remember, we're trying NOT to get the guy executed.
4,0,0,Juror 6 is looking a little woozy. Please tell me that's because not of you.
3,1,0,It's evidence; you'll get the scythe back after the trial.
3,0,0,They're going to try to present you as a hostile witness.
3,1,0,I'd lose the hood. Show them you've nothing to hide.
4,0,0,Mr. Scrooge doesn't have a ghost of a chance. You can't sue for being frightened into giving everything to charity.
2,1,0,What are you doing here now? You are expected after the judgement.
3,1,0,I was just doing my job is not really a good defense in this case
2,2,0,My job is to get you outta here alive.
4,0,0,"I liked the Brooks Brothers button down more.
4,0,0,Well, you could accept the plea deal to become a Life Coach in Canada.
4,0,0,No offense, but I can make a very strong anti-death penalty case for you.
3,0,0,I'm afraid he did take it with him.
3,1,0,What say we ask for a change of venue?
3,1,0,I'll try my best, but that's a load of parking tickets.
4,0,0,Let's just say I had expected your taxes to be a pretty certain come April 15th.
4,0,0,Your tonsure is telling
3,0,1,I don't think it's wise to tell each juror when you intend to visit them.
3,1,0,"Profiling" will not be an adequate defense in this case.
2,2,0,Yes, but they can't prove that it's YOUR scythe.
3,1,0,Spin it how you like, no one believes you're the life and soul of any party
4,0,0,You're sure the hoodie doesn't fit?
4,0,0,Look, I know you don't usually do this, but in this case I really think you ought to accept the plea deal.
4,0,0,Look right at number four when you say 'death penalty' and he'll come around.
3,1,0,The jury has a sense of humour. They're suggesting life imprisonment.
3,0,1,If you want a jury of your peers, I'll file a motion to have the trial moved to Death Valley.
2,1,1,Stop looking at me like that!
4,0,0,Larry, the grim reaper look isn't a great choice to wear to your hearing this morning.
3,0,0,The verbal contract does state "til death do us part".
3,0,0,I think you should make the final statement.
4,0,0,Don't mention the war.
4,0,0,I can reassure you, that is no precedent second time for death role.
3,0,0,Yes, I think the death penalty is a possibility.
3,1,0,We’re going to argue that all your actions were motivated by a sincerely held religious belief.
4,0,0,'Let me do the talking now, Donald'
2,2,0,You Honor, I've told him a hundred times that this is pro bono, but he keeps insisting that someone is going to pay for all this.
4,0,0,We're going for a mistrial, you didn't rape, you reaped.
3,1,0,I appreciate you see the case as res judicata; even so I'd like to earn my fee.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'm gonna kill this guy on cross.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed you'd wear a suit.
4,0,0,Yes, your chances are also grim.
3,1,0,Don't worry. They can't find you on Facebook.
3,1,0,Don't take this the wrong way, but I saw this coming.
2,1,1,No, getting the death penalty is not a good thing.
3,1,0,Don't worry. It's mortality as a whole that's on trial.
2,1,0,It's usually the other way around, but these witnesses are killing us.
3,1,0,As your attorney, I must advise you to stop pointing to the jurors.
3,1,0,I think I can get them to take the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,I told you to wear something professional.
3,0,1,You're looking at the death penalty.
3,0,0,Leave the objections to me, ok?
3,1,0,Please stop referring to it as the "you penalty".
2,1,0,I don't think that is what they meant by assisted death.
4,0,0,Your odds of winning the case are looking grim.
4,0,0,No, you can't ask the prosecutor what his health plan covers
3,1,0,Sorry, this is traffic court....
2,0,0,Just be thankful this state abolished the death penalty.
4,0,0,My wife told me this case would kill me.
2,1,0,Don't worry, I'm the best wrongful death lawyer in the county.
3,1,0,Let me get this straight... You're willing to swear, under oath, that you were framed by a guy named Bergman?
4,0,0,We can plea bargain for a life sentence.
2,2,0,Yes, the witness looks like death warmed over.
3,0,1,Please stop giggling every time the word death is mentioned.
2,2,0,We win this in the sentencing phase.
3,0,1,Well, at least you don't have any priors... right?
4,0,0,The anonymous mask is better.
3,1,0,This would be a good time to look every juror in the eye.
3,1,0,Stop it. I’ll handle jury selection.
4,0,0,We've got an excellent case--they have no witnesses.
3,1,0,Frankly, I don't want you as my lawyer.
3,0,1,Deny, deny, deny
4,0,0,Remember, no killing the judge.
4,0,0,That character witness you gave us has a stygian address.
3,1,0,Your witness failed to show up again, Death.
3,1,0,The death penalty has no effect here.
3,1,0,Thanks for not bringing the scythe
3,0,0,You see, when a comedian dies on stage, it's just a saying.
1,3,0,No, punishable by death does not mean you get to pick your own sentence.
4,0,0,Fortunately the state's outlawed eternal life.
3,1,0,We probably should have plead out.
2,1,1,You sure don't look innocent!
4,0,0,Remember, try to avoid eye contact with anyone on the jury.
1,1,2,They are digging up a jury of your peers.
2,1,0,It doesn't matter who sent you. You still needed a green card.
0,2,2,So, do we feel good or bad about the death penalty?
3,0,1,So, no matter what happens, we’re still good, right?
2,1,1,They're not going to care if it's your job, it's still tampering.
4,0,0,The hoodie is not helping us.
2,0,2,No, despite what you may think, a hung jury does not mean you can go back to work.
3,1,0,Okay, how about Jazz Hands?
3,0,0,If you're acquited, can we discuss D.T.?
3,1,0,You know that wearing a hoodie leads to an automatic conviction.
4,0,0,It's OK. It's OK. Not a setback. I felt like we had to try Jurisdiction. Now we'll go for habeas corpus, that's where we'll get you off.
3,0,1,Look, it's an all-white jury. Ditch the hoodie!
2,1,1,I may be going out on a limb here but I'm going to assume the death penalty won't be a major problem for you.
3,1,0,Sorry, but there is a strict no hat rule.
2,2,0,Just telling you, this judge doesn't like hoodies
3,1,0,The jury's looking Grim.
0,3,1,Sorry, Death, but you're getting life.
4,0,0,Our only chance is to play the grace card.
3,0,1,Unfortunately that's not what they mean by habeus corpus.
4,0,0,I don't like where this is headed. What do you think?
2,2,0,Remember, the victim touched you.
4,0,0,It's important the jury doesn't know where you're coming from.
4,0,0,Sorry, I think they are going to give you life!
4,0,0,"Don't worry---your not gonna get 'life' on this.
3,1,0,Yes, shaving would have helped.
4,0,0,But here business casual means no hoodies.
4,0,0,I don’t think “It was the salmon mousse” will work as a defense.
4,0,0,Remember - during cross-examination, stay grim.
3,1,0,Don't worry. This judge doesn't believe in the death penalty.
4,0,0,In this case, what you reaped sued you.
4,0,0,Once again, you're missing the nuance here: Being in a death penalty jurisdiction doesn't mean you had the right to apply it that night.
3,1,0,Let me guess, imaginary death panels, right?
4,0,0,The death penalty is definitely on the table.
4,0,0,They got Al Capone, but I think we're good.
4,0,0,I thought you said you'd only charge an arm and a leg!
3,0,0,Great news. The judge has approved our plea bargain for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Yes, you are death. But the IRS is going to argue you still have to pay your taxes.
3,0,1,Juror number seven? Tonight? Wow, what are the odds?
4,0,0,Listen up! You are the flip side of an OB/GYN." "Listen up! You are the flip side of an OB/GYN.
4,0,0,Hmm, a life sentence does sound unusually harsh, let's see what we can do.
2,2,0,No DNA, no fingerprints, no positive ID – we’ll beat this easy.
4,0,0,You say my wife hired you?
4,0,0,I’m not sure if it’s irony or synergy, but I started out as a tax attorney.
3,1,0,Remember: you had an appointment in Samarra.
3,1,0,At least you won't need to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, this is a class action lawsuit.
4,0,0,Our best strategy is to ask for life.
3,1,0,You couldn't have worn something a little less grim for my first trial?
4,0,0,My best argument is that giving you the death penalty would be a definitional impossibility, as well as just plain silly.
3,0,1,Remember, I'll do the talking.
3,1,0,Of course We'll appeal it if they give you "Life."
4,0,0,Look, I don't care if you are Clarence Darrow, I don't want any help!
2,1,1,You're in luck--all their witnesses have mysteriously died.
4,0,0,OK fine, there may be no eyewitnesses. But haven't you ever heard of circumstantial evidence?
0,3,0,Existentially speaking...... I don't think we can lose.
4,0,0,I'm the ambulance chaser
4,0,0,Even though our side can no longer count on Scalia's vote, we can still consult him.
3,0,0,Relax. God is taking care of this.
3,0,1,No fingerprints! No problem!
3,1,0,Duck. She said the robberr was wearing a hoodie.
3,0,1,dont worry you will get time off for good behaviour
4,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying your not guilty plea.
1,3,0,Just say that it's a family name.
2,1,0,I think you're looking at the death penalty.
2,1,1,Saying it was his appointed day is not going to get you off
4,0,0,Look, I know it works for Zuckerberg, but...
3,0,0,You're right - you should do the closing argument.
4,0,0,In your case the sentence would be dinner with Donald Trump
4,0,0,Remember, a life sentence is a bad one, not a good one.
3,1,0,You have a right to remain silent.
4,0,0,This is not a sympathetic jury
4,0,0,The jury is still hopelessly deadlocked.
3,1,0,Unfortunately, the writ your referring to isn't actually pronounced "habeas corpses."
4,0,0,No, the judge did not approve your bail.
3,0,0,No you plead the *Fifth*, not the Sythe.
3,0,0,I think you're being a little overdramatic—it's just a parking ticket.
4,0,0,He wants ten more years. Let's offer two good and three so-so.
3,1,0,When you're on the stand, try to look affable and fun-loving.
4,0,0,I strongly advise you not to use the Twinkie defense.
4,0,0,Ya know, that outfit doesn't exactly exude innocence.
2,1,1,You want to plead 'guilty as sin?'
4,0,0,I love your half glass full attitude, it makes me feel so alive
3,1,0,It's looking grim, Reaper.
2,0,1,Don't worry, defending serial killers is my specialty!
3,1,0,The good news is, you'll get capital punishment.
4,0,0,When I said dress up this is not what I meant
2,1,0,Please try not to approach the witness.
3,1,0,We're screwed - this judge is pro-life.
2,1,0,I'm sorry, they will not allow you to execute yourself.
4,0,0,You said what?
2,2,0,Could you stop glancing at the judge and then checking your watch? It's not helping us.
4,0,0,It will be easier to get you off if you ditch the hoodie.
1,3,0,Remember, our position is "Scythes kill people."
3,1,0,We've already set one precedent. We now have a strong case to set a second one and win your tax appeal.
2,1,0,Wait...is this just another lawyer joke?
4,0,0,The court's landmark decision in United States v. Death led to the break-up of the world's largest monopoly.
3,1,0,How many death penalty cases have you won again?
4,0,0,I told my wife I couldn't go to the store last night because I had an appointment with you. She told me to get a life.
2,2,0,And what happens if you do get the death penalty?
3,1,0,I think we'll be able to avoid a life sentence.
4,0,0,I suggest you lose the hoodie. It scares the jurors.
4,0,0,So, your saying no need to bother taking the 5th. Hmmm.
3,1,0,We'll petition for a change of venue to 13th century Florence.
3,0,1,Trite or not, the wardrobe malfunction defense is your best chance.
4,0,0,We'll just say it was self-defense.
4,0,0,If this were Texas, the "He needed killing" defense might have worked.
4,0,0,It would have killed you to wear a suit?
3,1,0,Honestly, I don't think that you should testify.
3,1,0,When you get up there try to look friendly and non-threatening.
3,1,0,Max von Sydow refused to be a character witness.
4,0,0,That doesn't sound like good advice!!
4,0,0,They aren't buying our discounted future earnings.
3,1,0,Your hoodie makes you look guilty.
4,0,0,Apparently you can't stand your ground with a scythe.
4,0,0,You're right, I don't think the Most Wanted poster is what gave you away...
3,0,1,Your Honor, my client pleads not guilty on the grounds that he was just doing his job.
1,1,2,Stop it. They'll just keep bringing in a new judge.
3,0,1,They can't prove a thing without the scythe.
3,1,0,I'm glad you took my advice and left the scythe at home.
4,0,0,They got you on tax evasion, of that I am certain.
0,2,1,Good News... another hung jury...
4,0,0,Tell me again how you were identified in the police line-up.
2,1,0,Wrongful death is really not a good way to boost your numbers
3,0,1,"Whatever you do, don't smile at the jury".
3,1,0,Is there anyone who can corroborate your whereabouts who isn't dead?
3,1,0,I think the hoodie might give the jury the wrong impression.
3,1,0,We can get you time off for good behavior.
3,1,0,Keep the scythe hidden, and try to be a little less grim.
2,1,0,I'll assume you will be seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,This case is beginning to look very grim
2,1,1,There is no death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,I told you winning a chess game is not admissible evidence.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed on business casual.
2,1,0,"You should maintain eye contact with the jurors so they believe your innocence".
4,0,0,The hood both helps and hurts.
4,0,0,The prosecution is seeking the You penalty.
2,2,0,We can't plead insanity for ALL of them
4,0,0,Take off your hood, you're being insensitive.
3,0,0,Even death deserves a good defense.
4,0,0,Look, Death, the hoodie’s not helping your case here.
4,0,0,I'll go after her on Benghazi and the emails. If that doesn't work, you're up.
2,2,0,No more hand motions across your throat, it's hurting our case.
3,0,1,Let's hope for a hung jury.
3,0,1,Are you still there?
4,0,0,I can't believe I got a life sentence... I'm Death
4,0,0,I told you, no hoodies.
1,1,2,It was his time" may not be the best defense.
2,1,1,I was hoping you would wear your blue suit with the red tie.
1,2,0,That witness is looking a little sick. Need I say more?
1,2,1,I'm sorry, but they've taken the death penalty off the table.
2,0,2,Try not to hang the jury this time.
3,1,0,How can you tell me to face the truth, sir?
3,0,1,The prosecution took the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,We have to establish a jury connection. What are you scared of?
4,0,0,They have a witness who saw The Man Without A Face.
4,0,0,What do you mean, you always win?
3,0,1,No, I am not going to let you testify.
4,0,0,You're definately not helping my anxiety.
4,0,0,That "Line Up" ID certainly is not going to help our case.
4,0,0,There latest deal is eternal misery in the burning fires of hell, plus life.
4,0,0,We need a powerful closing statement.
2,1,0,For the millionth time, I WANT life!
3,0,0,They don't exactly 'give you' the chair.
4,0,0,Don't worry, I've been watching 'The People vs. OJ Simpson' we got this.
4,0,0,To gain the jury's approval, I strongly advise you to take a holiday.
4,0,0,The it's-my-job defense has no legal precedent."
4,0,0,Less grim and more sorrow with this judge
4,0,0,When were you planning to tell me about your private e-mail server?
4,0,0,You're a dead man with that plea.
3,0,1,Your email is Death@gmail.com?
4,0,0,You could throw yourself on the mercy of the court?
4,0,0,The best we can hope for is a sentence of life.
3,0,0,I think we may have a problem finding impartial jurors.
4,0,0,The DA is seeking life imprisonment without benefit of parole.
4,0,0,If you were merely a witness to his death we could make a plea bargain, but his family is sure you brought about his demise.
4,0,0,It looks pretty grim - how does manslaughter sound to you?
3,0,1,The burden is on the prosecution to produce a body.
3,0,0,The clothes make it difficult to argue that you're not cruel and unusual.
3,0,1,Remember, try to smile with your voice.
3,0,0,we just have to convince them that it's your job
4,0,0,You're dead, right?
4,0,0,And what is the impact you hope to create among the jurors? Will your current look inspire that, do you think?
3,1,0,We can appeal.
3,1,0,I'm not sure that look will result in a hung-jury.
3,1,0,I'm gonna go ahead and suggest that you not testify.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'll just tell them it's your job.
4,0,0,As your attorney, I recommend you take the plea deal.
1,1,2,Can we try jury selection my way?
3,1,0,Ever since the plague, public opinion is running way against you - our best bet is a plea bargain.
4,0,0,I never thought you'd be on trial for insider trading
2,1,1,I'm afraid the hoodie is a dead giveaway.
2,1,0,I'm just sayin', your dark side is darker and than most of my clients so work with me a bit today.
3,1,0,Who do they think they are giving ME the death penalty?
4,0,0,Let's face it - you haven't got a leg to stand on.
3,1,0,So is this your first time as the plaintiff?
3,0,0,The deal is contingent on you pleading nolo contendere on eleven and a half billion deaths.
2,1,0,You got life.
3,1,0,Do you really think I need to cop a plea?
2,1,1,They want to give you life.
0,2,2,No. You can't approach the witness.
2,1,1,Remember: if the scythe doesn't fit...
4,0,0,Worst case scenario you get life.
4,0,0,This is a big thrill for me. I usually handle taxes.
4,0,0,Try not to look so grim, Mr. Reaper.
2,1,0,If we lose this case, can you at least wait 20 years before you come for me?
1,2,0,Great news--the prosecution wants you to get life.
4,0,0,Now remember: When you're called to the stand, refrain from your 'Grim Reaper' routine.
4,0,0,Can you work work with me here? I'm not asking for tears, but we're doomed unless you can come up with a contrite expression.
4,0,0,Your membership in Grimm Reapers Matters is not helping
3,1,0,For God's sake - plead guilty! What do you have to lose?
4,0,0,Listen, Eminem, the Unibomber's intellectual property suit is not just going away; I really think we should offer a settlement.
2,2,0,We couldn't find any character witnesses.
2,1,1,I thought I told you to ditch the hoodie.
2,1,1,I've never had a case where the defendant's name and the sentence are the same.
1,2,0,Don't worry, we're going to appeal the life sentence. I'm gonna get you to death row.
3,1,0,At least you didn't bring the scythe to court-- that could help you.
3,1,0,Trust me. 'Wardrobe malfunction' is not the best way to go.
4,0,0,So you don't think a plea bargain is workable?
4,0,0,Am I in trouble because I can't remember my password?
3,1,0,The judge is asking for continuance again. Looks like another set of jury members died of "natural causes" last night.
1,1,1,This is traffic court, so I'm afraid the death penalty is off the table.
2,1,1,We'll fight to keep the life penalty off the table.
3,1,0,On the other hand, you could look at a death penalty decision as a win-win.
4,0,0,Visa of MasterCard, No Discovery
4,0,0,I knew a public defender would be a death sentence.
4,0,0,So you're saying, you came up with the title "To Kill A Mockingbird"...
4,0,0,So this is what your firm meant when they told me that my case looked grim.
3,0,1,Of course you want a hung jury.
3,1,0,Will you be picking the jury or shall I?
2,1,0,The problem is your alibi's dead too.
3,0,0,Try not to touch anything.
3,1,0,Cheer up-- the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,I strongly recommend against taking the stand.
2,1,1,So, the guy was already dead when you got there?
3,0,1,You may get life for killing that chess player.
4,0,0,How does a life sentence sound?
3,1,0,...they found you guilty, beyond a shadow of a doubt
4,0,0,They're going to ask for the Death Penalty, Let's accept it quick before they figure it out.
4,0,0,For the last time, nobody cares that you invented the hoodie.
2,2,0,I thought we agreed you would lose the hoodie for the trial.
3,1,0,No, I don't think it's a good idea for you to take the stand."
4,0,0,Do your best to avoid eye contact
4,0,0,No jury tampering. Besides illegal, your methods are a little obvious.
4,0,0,But, all your peers are dead.
4,0,0,Why so grim? The worst you can get is life.
2,1,1,I'm your lawyer, and you want me to ask for the death penalty?
3,1,0,They've agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Do not pull out the scythe when you're being cross-examined.
3,1,0,The best you can hope for is 20 years to death.
1,1,1,Well, it is an unusually large class action suit against you.
3,0,0,Sorry, but I can't hear you over the echo
3,1,0,To a jury, it's all about appeal, so please wear a coat and tie tomorrow.
2,1,0,No, no, no! It's pleading THE FIFTH, not pleading the scythe.
4,0,0,As your accountant, I told you it was inevitable.
2,1,1,We don't have a ghost of a chance.
4,0,0,Try not to look so vacant.
2,2,0,Yes, the judge and jury are aware that your arresting officers and the district attorney all passed away this week.
2,1,1,Honestly, let me handle this.
1,2,1,Anything less than the death penalty and we'll appeal.
2,0,2,What did I say about wearing a hoodie in court?
2,2,0,They want to know if Grim Reaper is an alias?
4,0,0,Life insurance at my age? I don't think so.
3,1,0,They've offered life without parole.
2,2,0,This place attracts a lot of movers and shakers.
3,1,0,We really need to stress to the jury that a guilty verdict would be against the best interests of everyone involved.
3,1,0,So, the counter-intuitive ensemble.
2,2,0,Just take the fifth if you're asked about taxes.
3,1,0,Really! Can't you miss one Halloween?
3,1,0,In America, every person has a second chance
4,0,0,Tell him you have a vow of silence.
1,3,0,Don't mention your day job.
4,0,0,I'll try to get you time served and a millennium in Purgatory.
4,0,0,The good news is it's not a capital offense.
4,0,0,This should be easy. We'll plead guilty and ask for leniency, the death penalty.
4,0,0,You could have put on a tie at least!
3,0,0,You're telling me it doesn't look good?
2,2,0,You're taking this 'See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil' thing a little too far.
2,2,0,What are you going to do when I tell you "Face the jury" ?
2,2,0,Remember, when you take the stand don't act proud.
1,2,1,We may have an issue with your likability among jurors.
3,1,0,I could have lent you a tie.
4,0,0,A visage less grim might reap a more favorable impression from the jurors.
3,1,0,At least capital punishment is out of the question.
4,0,0,Well, I wouldn't have chosen it but then again, I'm not guilty.
3,1,0,Tell the court that your job is to die for.
4,0,0,We'll make the jury buy that the act was consensual.
4,0,0,Okay, okay. We'll seek the death penalty.
4,0,0,So you're saying I could get life for this?
3,1,0,Okay, you can take the stand, but don't talk them to death!
4,0,0,I understand you are a serious individual, but if we can talk about your personal interests--say, your troll doll collection, for example--perhaps the jury will be able to relate to you a little better.
3,1,0,There is no prima facie evidence.
4,0,0,Do a lot of capital cases do you?
0,2,1,Thanks, but no. When I said we could use a hung jury, that's not what I meant.
3,0,0,And remember, no mention of your contacts in the underworld.
2,1,0,When you say "spook the jurors", what does that mean?
2,2,0,Please stop touching the witnesses.
2,2,0,O.K!, O.K!, pro bono it is.
4,0,0,Why strike him? Seriously, "Angel" isn't that uncommon of a name in this community.
3,1,0,They're sentencing you to life.
3,1,0,Sorry, but this was a tough case.
3,0,1,Congress is not technically dead, it just doesn't do anything.
2,2,0,What do you mean you feel this is a case of profiling?
3,0,0,I can't believe the nerve of this prosecutor . . . asking for the You Penalty.
3,1,0,Bad news. They recovered the scythe.
3,0,1,I realize the hoodie is part of your brand, but in this social context it's counterproductive.
4,0,0,I know I'm the best defense attorney in the country....but would it kill you to try looking a little more life affirming?
2,1,1,Relax--you know you'll never serve life.
1,2,1,Try showing some empathy.
4,0,0,I don't think they'll believe you're not taking the stand because you have a migraine.
4,0,0,Are you the hollow man?
3,1,0,Now remember -- jurors pay a lot of attention to body language, especially facial expression and eye movements.
3,1,0,Can you get the death sentence off the table?
4,0,0,Three words: Failure. To. Appear.
3,1,0,Eventhough the jury see themselves in you, my advice remains for you not to testify.
4,0,0,Somehow I don't think this is the best way to avoid suspicion, governor.
4,0,0,Our alibi is taxes.
3,1,0,Permission to treat the witness as hostile?
3,1,0,I guess it's time to break it to you - I don't think the jury believes you are Darth Vader.
1,1,1,Moving this trial to the financial district is the only way we'll find a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,Think we should plea bargain for 'life'??
4,0,0,So what if I didn't help you in my last incarnation. I promise to do better this time.
1,2,1,In this case, the penalty would be yourself.
3,0,0,Don't worry - the wages of sin are clearly specified.
1,2,0,You realize you're facing life?
4,0,0,Sometimes there is just no defense possible!
3,1,0,No problem. The death penalty would be double jeopardy.
3,1,0,Well, yes. Scientology does enforce that Billion Year Contract.
4,0,0,Not to worry", it's called double indemnity.
4,0,0,You're telling me you're not afraid of the death penalty?
4,0,0,I think we're having trouble with the sympathy vote.
2,0,2,Ironically, they want the death penalty.
4,0,0,rumor is the jury's hung
2,1,1,We could go with a Insanity plea or you could just use the Jedi mind trick and We can be out in Ten minutes !
3,0,0,And remember, nobody likes a negative Nelly.
2,2,0,In your case, I'd say dress for the sentence you want and not the job you have.
3,1,0,Truth be told, our chances of winning this case are looking pretty grim...
2,2,0,I advise you to wear a suit next time.
2,2,0,Loose the hoodie. It makes you look too Silicon Valley.
4,0,0,What do you mean you won't 'accept' a life sentence?
1,1,2,HOW many priors?
4,0,0,They have a heluva lot of circumstantial evidence.
4,0,0,I hope you're not losing your head over this trial.
3,0,0,People accepted you until you took Michael Jackson
3,1,0,Try to look likable for the jury.
2,1,1,I told you not to wear your work clothes to court.
2,2,0,The statute of limitations covers most of these.
3,1,0,I think you're going to like your sentence
2,2,0,Watch out for Juror #4. Her grandmother just died.
3,1,0,Just say that you weren't there.
2,2,0,As my attorney, you said you could make this all go away.
4,0,0,Couldn't you have picked a better outfit to show the jury?
4,0,0,I can't be anymore clear, do not shake hands with the judge.
4,0,0,My affairs? Of course they're in order. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,Fortunately the judge has a macabre sense of humor.
2,1,1,I wouldn't use that expression with this judge.
4,0,0,In order to beat the prosecution, we need to get you ahead.
3,1,0,Yes, the acquittal is nice, but it's the civil trial where they'll kill you.
1,3,0,Please don't take him until he pays my bill.
4,0,0,Fortunately, this State does not carry the death penalty.
3,1,0,No, you can't be the executioner.
1,3,0,We need to make this guy think he's looking Death right in the face.
2,2,0,There's no getting around this. You're going to have to put your hand on the Bible.
3,0,0,Don't look at me like that. You're the one who said you don't have fingerprints.
4,0,0,Now, that's grim.
3,1,0,I don't think "It was his time" will sway the jury.
3,0,1,We need the jury on your side. Relax, smile, and stop killing them.
4,0,0,You're not used to it?! Just plead the fifth. It's not the same as begging for your life.
4,0,0,Well you're not making jury selection any easier.
4,0,0,hello
1,2,0,When the sentence is death, I need you to act surprised.
3,1,0,You're being charged with 100 billion murders.
4,0,0,"Now??, like right now?".
2,0,2,When you ID the perpetrator it'd be best not to point.
4,0,0,You must have misunderstood. I said I am deadly in court.
4,0,0,It will be easier now that we succeeded in getting a separate trial for Taxes.
4,0,0,So you say in Hell there are ONLY attorneys or there's just a special place for us there?
3,1,0,Your scythe may only be symbolic, but it is admissible.
3,0,0,Try looking less grim.
2,0,1,I thought we agreed on the frilly pink blouse.
4,0,0,I'm afraid just arguing 'his number was up' isn't going to get you acquitted
4,0,0,You still have the right to remain silent, but here you'll have to claim the Fifth Amendment.
4,0,0,What do you mean You are The "Devils' Advocate"?
3,0,0,I'm going for a hung jury. Whether if you want me to use rope or fallacious arguments is completely your call.
3,1,0,Could you try to look less grim?
4,0,0,Your hoodie and your fingers still gives you away.
3,1,0,I told you, nobody's going to take you seriously if you dress like that.
2,0,1,The good news is you'll never get life.
1,2,1,Let's challenge Juror number four. Her grandma died recently.
3,1,0,Just keep your poker face.
2,2,0,Good news. One of the jurors is an undertaker.
4,0,0,I can only prove your innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt.
4,0,0,assume you are ok with a hung jury
3,0,0,I was told there'd be no math.
2,2,0,It's looking grim, Grim.
4,0,0,We'll use your internet entrepreneur status in the character defense.
3,1,0,After your testimony, the judge will understand just who is at risk for the death penalty.
1,1,2,I advise avoiding eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,No you won't testify. They will have to take things at face value.
3,1,0,First time offenders get the born-again treatment.
2,1,0,I'd say the jury's seriously considering the death penalty, but not for the usual reasons.
2,2,0,Just say you are self employed.
3,1,0,I don't think symphony is a good strategy here. Try looking less grim. Go get an iced tea. :::::::::::::::::::,,,
1,2,1,The IRS case against you is weak, but nothing's certain ...
2,1,0,No Hoodies in the court room
2,2,0,The sentence might be life.
3,1,0,So then, where is thy sting?
2,1,0,Repeat after me, religious freedom.
3,1,0,I will try to get them to call you just Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,As your attorney I strongly advise you not to plead self-defense.
1,1,2,Think of the irony if they give you life.
4,0,0,Sorry, but in my legal opinion,'The butler did it' is not a viable defense.
3,0,1,We could have a problem with the "corpus" part of the writ.
2,1,1,You may have taken Habeas Corpus a bit too literally
3,1,0,"God made me do it!" is not a defense that's ever worked before.
2,1,1,No, I don't think we should go for the death penalty. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,They couldn't see your face in that hoodie.
0,1,1,It would be time for that killer closing you keep talking about.
1,3,0,The jury's going to want to know if you're in favor of the Death Penalty.
4,0,0,Plead insanity and say you lost your head.
4,0,0,I can't ethically accept 'never dying' as payment. I'm handling this case pro bono.
3,0,1,Yes, I know what happens if we lose.
4,0,0,His early death was a simple case of mistaken identity. Occupational hazard, right?
4,0,0,I don't suppose you can suggest any character witnesses?
4,0,0,It's not meant as an insult. Around here death IS a penalty.
3,1,0,I'm sorry. But the irony would be too much to ask the judge to overturn your life- in-prison sentence, just because you hate orange.
3,0,1,My suggesting to "Dress to Kill" was a metaphor.
4,0,0,Sorry, Bill Belichick took the look.
3,1,0,We'll take the death-and taxes-sure-things stance.
2,1,0,I told you, we're not in France. Besides, they don't do that anymore.
4,0,0,Just remember, they cheated you.
3,0,1,Sure, a hung jury would be great for us. Why do you ask?
2,1,0,If you're going to take me away why couldn't you have done it before court?
4,0,0,You got anything in there that could pass for charm? The jury hates you.
4,0,0,This defamation suit against Deep Purple was a mistake.
4,0,0,Don't worry, giving you the death penalty would be suicide.
2,1,0,You're worried about the composite?
4,0,0,I said 'sole' defense - not 'soul' defense.
2,2,0,In my opinion...... your chances are grim.
4,0,0,Are they treating you all right in there? You look like death.
4,0,0,Your death sentence is being appealed.
2,1,1,I'm getting the feeling you want the death penalty.
3,1,0,Try not to intimidate the witnesses
4,0,0,Fortunately, a life sentence is out of the question.
3,1,0,I told you the scythe wouldn't get through the metal detector.
3,0,0,But don't you at least want to hear my closing first?
3,0,0,I think the best we can get you here is life.
3,1,0,Try to show some emotion.
3,1,0,Eventually, you know, they'll want to de-pose you.
4,0,0,So if you get the death penalty, what are you worried about?
3,1,0,You've got nothing to worry about---this state doesn't have a Death penalty.
4,0,0,I think I can get you off if we can prove she binged at Chipotle.
2,1,0,Please stop challenging the prosecutor to a game of chess.
4,0,0,Let me do the talking!
4,0,0,Look Mr. Death I accepted parsnips for your dui but this is a pandemic I'm going to need cash.
3,0,0,Am I here for you or are you here for me?
2,1,1,I think your number of priors are working against you, guy.
3,0,0,Remember to tell the truth but don't bring up that death stuff
2,0,2,It's important to make eye contact with the jury.
3,0,1,Would it have killed you to wear a coat and tie?
3,1,0,Let's not bring your scythe up to the witness stand. It might send a mixed message to the jury.
4,0,0,Relax, this is a witch hunt. It's not you they're after.
3,1,0,Sorry! Scythes aren't allowed in the courtroom.
4,0,0,OK... You'll will get 20 % every time someone says, prints, or by any way communicates the phrase, 'Death & Taxes'!
4,0,0,Relax, without the scythe they don't have a case.
4,0,0,They've offered you a great plea--I think you'll really reap the benefits.
2,1,0,Tell the jury you'll save them a place in Heaven.
2,1,1,I told you to wear a suit, no hoodies in the courtroom!
4,0,0,...then i said, the IRS does not believe in karma, Mr. Smith
2,1,0,What behavior could even be unbecoming of a Grim Reaper?
4,0,0,I’m sorry Mr. Kenobi, it doesn’t look like you’ll be collecting any royalties from the new film.
4,0,0,Are you saying - as your lawyer, I must argue it was inevitable?
4,0,0,Things are looking grim.
2,1,0,Don't worry. They'll be happy to make a deal.
4,0,0,You know, Donald, you have an aura about you.
4,0,0,For the last time, there is no death penalty in this state.
2,1,0,Plead not guilty then we'll implicate Father Time.
4,0,0,Say nothing about your black hole theory
4,0,0,SORRY, THIS'LL TAKE LONGER THAN THAT.
2,1,1,Listen to me--can you say "so help me God"?
3,1,0,Well, looks like you're getting life.
4,0,0,I know, I know, they told me they were out of lethal injection drugs.
3,0,0,That vanishing cream company will pay through the nose.
4,0,0,We will maintain that this is a case of mistaken identity.
3,1,0,You got life without parole.
3,1,0,I'll try and argue for concurrent sentences.
3,0,1,Let's discuss the meaning of "life".
4,0,0,So you're saying that your defense is that you have no face?
3,1,0,The defendant doesn't appreciate your not so subtle prediction.
3,1,0,It looks pretty grim.
3,1,0,Remember what we talked about...eye contact, eye contact, eye contact!
4,0,0,I think you should take the plea deal.
2,2,0,You have the right to remain deathly silent.
4,0,0,I think you got the death penalty
4,0,0,You know, I'm actually a woman.
4,0,0,"They're offering 25 to life." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
3,1,0,It's not like they can give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,By the way, I wouldn't mention anything about that large scythe of yours...
2,2,0,If I were you, I would take care of Juror No. 5.
2,2,0,I think we'll just skip the character witness part.
3,1,0,Listen, Leroy. Quoting the Unabomber is not helping your case.
3,0,0,I have to advise you to keep a low profile.
3,1,0,Gotta say, these are the most amicable divorce proceedings I've witnessed!
4,0,0,Do you have any lighter clothes? A tie maybe?
4,0,0,He took a plea, if you want I'm you'll have to sit at the defense table!
2,1,1,It doesn't look good. Instead of the death penalty, they're offering life in prison.
4,0,0,That's not what they mean by "Death Tax".
1,1,1,Relax. I specialize in getting my clients the death penalty.
2,2,0,Thanks for not bringing the scythe today.
1,3,0,Your case is a grave situation.
3,1,0,I don’t think the jury is going to buy our grim reaper defense.
4,0,0,On the bright side, there's no death penalty.
4,0,0,I'm glad you came, I didn't have a shot in this case.
4,0,0,Where are your character witnesses again?
3,0,0,Just think, this trial has us both staring at death.
3,0,0,Whenever you answer, just try to sound sympathetic.
3,0,1,I think you will get life.
2,2,0,Relax. You were just doing your job.
3,0,0,Because your robe fits; you might as well call it quits!
1,2,1,Try not to touch anyone else on the way to the stand.
4,0,0,I am afraid the brief I am submitting is a bit grim. I hope my brief is not too grim.
4,0,0,Yes, I suppose the death penalty isn't such a bad option.
3,1,0,Just how many of these cases are there?
3,1,0,Don't worry, the jury likes you!
4,0,0,If they find you guilty, getting life will be a miracle.
4,0,0,Listen, involuntary manslaughter is going to be a hard sell.
4,0,0,Try to make eye contact with the jurors
4,0,0,Okay, I'll handle the civil cases, you do the estates.
2,1,1,Your testimony may have grim reapercussions.
2,1,1,Do you not own another suit?
2,2,0,It might work to your benefit if we say you own a startup company.
2,2,0,With the number of prior convictions, I recommend you plead.
4,0,0,Probably not a great idea to mention the scythe.
4,0,0,If you get me off, I will guarantee you a cushy afterlife!
4,0,0,Counsel for the defense, you may step down.
4,0,0,I don't know if the death sentence is viable in Judge Judy.
3,0,1,They're going for your penalty.
4,0,0,Do I have enough time to put in my football tips?
2,2,0,On the positive side, your priors are inadmissible.
4,0,0,The plea is guilty or not guilty not I just lost my head.
4,0,0,Don't worry. They have no witness.
4,0,0,We plan to appeal on the grounds that you cannot be sentenced to yourself.
2,1,1,Relax. I got O.J. off.
3,1,0,If you get too close to the judge up there, expecto some major patronum.
3,1,0,I strongly recommend you plead the Fifth.
3,1,0,How does the death penalty sound to you?
4,0,0,We're gonna need you to cry
1,2,1,Take the plea and we'll have you out in half an eternity.
4,0,0,If they sentence you to death, please don't gloat.
3,1,0,Well, it seems you have some priors.....
4,0,0,Let me understand this, you want to remain faceless in you eye witness testimony?
3,1,0,The IRS isn't ready to release you from your tax liability.
4,0,0,'The prosecution wants the death penalty...'
3,1,0,Worst case scenario, you're looking at life.
4,0,0,The hoody doesn't help.
4,0,0,No, really, who are you?
3,0,0,It doesn't look good--the sentence for open carry of a scythe is from here to eternity.
3,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie--not a Halloween custome.
3,1,0,I know, hooded creepy guys matter, I totally get it
4,0,0,Our biggest disadvantage? While very explicit the video shows all of you but your face.
4,0,0,My client would like to plead not guilty by reason of nihilism.
3,1,0,Just need to make sure we agree on what we mean by jury 'selection' . . .
3,0,0,I warned you that testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is especially deadly.
3,1,0,It's called a metal detector, and you need to stop whining.
3,0,0,Keep your mouth shut.
2,2,0,Yes, of course, my fee is negotiable.
4,0,0,We'll convince the jury you were a victim of mistaken identity.
3,0,0,you're not the judge, jury, nor executioner
4,0,0,Don't look on the dark side. Juries like diversity.
1,2,0,Don't worry, you have a solid alibi. Someone else somewhere died at the same time as this victim.
2,2,0,At least try looking remorseful.
2,2,0,They're offering a life sentence.
4,0,0,No, no . . . _you're_ going to be executed.
4,0,0,Mr Reaper, if you know anything about that scythe, now would be the time to tell me.
4,0,0,It will help with the jury if you appear a little less grim.
4,0,0,I don't think your alibi is going to hold up.
1,1,1,Nothing is certain in tax cases.
4,0,0,Can you wait until next month? These character witnesses will turn this case around.
3,1,0,Of course our services are complementary ... as a matter of professional courtesy.
4,0,0,How would you feel about a sentence of life without parole?
3,1,0,"We need to talk about your courtroom attire".
4,0,0,Perhaps I should deliver the closing argument instead.
4,0,0,..and your claim is as the ghostwriter ?
4,0,0,This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked you to dress modestly for court today.
3,1,0,No, I do not think you have one of those faces people trust.
3,1,0,"Don't be offended if they refer to you as an empty suit.
4,0,0,"We need you to get on the stand to show that they do not have a Prima Facie case...
3,1,0,They will claim you murdered about 56,000,000 people a year. We counter with an Insanity Defense
2,2,0,Try to look less guilty.
3,0,1,Remember, it's "Your Honor" not "You're next"
4,0,0,Don't worry. Looking like Donald Trump is not litigatable
2,2,0,It's all circumstantial. No skin on the hands means no fingerprints on the scythe.
4,0,0,It's do or die, not open and shut.
3,1,0,Remember, this jury does NOT appreciate 'Gallows Humour'...
4,0,0,Following orders of Sauron is not a good defense.
4,0,0,But the most hurtful part was being accused of lacking judgment.
3,0,0,I think there's a hole in our case.
3,1,0,I'm death. That's what you want nme to go with?
2,2,0,Well, really, it's not cruel OR unusual for you, is it?
3,0,1,I suggest a plea of not guilty by reason of inevitability.
3,0,1,I'll sum up for the jury and you take the penalty phase.
4,0,0,There is no option to plead "repent! The end is nigh!"
4,0,0,Let me explain again. Nothing in Law is ever final.
3,1,0,I'll try to get you death. But they may stick you with life. (italicize or underline try)
4,0,0,Our case is simple. Facebook has no right to reject you.
4,0,0,They sentenced you to a light year!
2,2,0,Did you have to wear that hoodie today?
3,1,0,You are looking at the 'you penalty.'
4,0,0,Try not to be too dark.
4,0,0,I took this case Pro Bono.
4,0,0,You can't take him literally, he means all dairy workers.
4,0,0,I'm afraid they're seeking the death penalty.
3,0,0,Not what I meant by your 'best suit'
2,1,0,My recommendation for you is, Lose the hoodie.
3,0,1,I hope you have your affairs in order.
3,1,0,How are my chances?
2,1,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie!
3,1,0,I'm dying to hear the verdict.
4,0,0,Do you appreciate the irony of my plea bargaining in exchange for 'life'?
2,2,0,That's not exactly what I had in mind when I mentioned a hung jury.
3,1,0,Your fingerprints are on the scythe.
2,0,1,Self-defense is going to be a tough sell.
2,2,0,I know the prints don't match.
3,1,0,It's nothing personal, but I think I'd like to represent myself from now on.
3,1,0,They're seeking the YOU penalty.
3,1,0,There's no DNA, so just say the scythe doesn't belong to you.
4,0,0,Five 99-year sentences, running consecutively, sounds harsh, but I doubt you're in more than 70 years tops.
4,0,0,Might as well risk the death penalty.
4,0,0,If you're found guilty, it will be a life for Death decision.
3,1,0,...and if I loose your case?
4,0,0,We're trying to avoid the death sentence.
3,0,1,If you agree with the involuntary manslaughter plea, nod your hood.
4,0,0,So...What's our deadline?
4,0,0,Don't worry, we're up right after Martin Shkreli.
2,1,0,The other party is taking a less literal view of the agreement's 'drop dead date.'
4,0,0,Joint custody is acceptable but I will not budge on the gardening tools.
3,0,1,There is no higher court.
4,0,0,Don't worry. I'm requesting an anonymous jury. They will relate to you.
2,2,0,There seems to be consensus in the jury that the death penalty in this case would not be an issue..
3,1,0,Did you get the license?
3,1,0,As your lawyer, I can't help you if you insist on wearing a hoodie
3,0,0,Hopefully I can bill you enough hours to pay for my dad’s medication.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, the best I can get you is life.
3,1,0,Didn't I ask you to wear a tie?
4,0,0,I may actually put you on the stand.
2,1,0,Judge Deepcoat, I'm afraid we have to reveal more than your nickname to get Senate's confirmation for SCOTUS.
2,1,1,Didn't I advise against wearing the hoodie in court?
3,1,0,And I wouldn't bring up the 'habeus corpus' angle.
4,0,0,It's not me who's on trial here, Mr. Reaper.
2,2,0,Are you here for me or my case?
3,1,0,As your lawyer, I suggest you not testify in this wrongful death suit.
4,0,0,I have told you, automatism it is our only defense.
3,1,0,The truth is, all nine of them are trying to cheat you.
4,0,0,And don't say "Read my lips!" again.
1,2,1,For the jury, focus more on the 'angel' than the 'death' part.
2,1,1,Case deceased.
4,0,0,Did you take his life?
4,0,0,Sometimes I get lost just looking into your eyes.
3,0,1,Your scythe is being held as evidence.
4,0,0,Sorry, sir, but I don't own a blue tie.
2,1,1,They're asking for the death penalty, but I don't think they've thought the logistics through properly.
3,1,0,The optics aren't working in your favor.
3,0,0,It's going to be very difficult to afford to avoid the death penalty.
3,0,0,That's pretty grim news, that I'll reap what I sow.
4,0,0,Take the plea bargain. Trust me.
2,2,0,For the last time, It was His Time, is not a viable defense
2,2,0,The jury is not likely to award you his soul in punitive damages.
3,1,0,Do you go by Grim or Mr Reaper....
2,0,0,Looks like your going to miss your tee time, the judge is keeping the death penalty on the table.
3,0,0,I'm going to need you to stop hanging the jury. Thanks.
3,1,0,I had nothing to wear and nowhere to hide.
4,0,0,Are you sure you want to take the stand?
3,0,0,You promised to wear a tie.
3,1,0,Witness: "I can't say for certain. It was either him or taxes."
3,0,1,Worst case? Life.
4,0,0,Does my elbow touching your elbow count as me being dead?
3,0,0,Am I getting life?
3,0,0,How do you feel about the death penalty?
3,1,0,Look on the bright side, you might get to meet Aaron Hernandez.
1,2,1,Let me tell you about my repeat customer discount.
3,1,0,Don't worry. If the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
4,0,0,Don't be so grim.
3,1,0,The right to face your accusers requires a little something on your part.
1,2,1,Maybe we should just ask for life.
4,0,0,They insist you remove your hood. Let me know when to look away.
3,1,0,Don't give me that look; prison's an upgrade.
4,0,0,You could've at least put on a tie.
1,2,0,Trust me, he won't hold you in contempt.
4,0,0,Pro bono, not pro bone.
3,0,0,We'll base our appeal on the grounds that the jury is 100% visible.
4,0,0,Our mistaken identity defense provides the jury reasonable doubt.
4,0,0,If the jury comes back with a guilty verdict you'll be looking at 25 to life.
3,1,0,Don't worry. What's the worst they can do? Sentence you to death?
3,1,0,We're going to argue for diminished responsibility, Mr. Reaper, on the grounds that your actions were controlled by another agent, Fate.
4,0,0,Don't be so grim. We have a good case.
3,1,0,If the hoodie doesn't fit, you must acquit.
4,0,0,When I say valley of shadows, you say supermarket.
3,0,0,I think I can get it knocked down to 107 billion counts of manslaughter.
3,0,1,They still haven't found a motive.
1,3,0,I'm just not sure the jury will buy your self-defense claim.
4,0,0,There's no way this jury will find you not guilty.
1,1,1,Would it kill you to smile once in awhile?
4,0,0,At least you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,No, I've already explained this: "I was just following orders" isn't a legitimate defense.
3,1,0,The judge wants you to list all the institutions that issued these certificates.
4,0,0,We have to prove that you were no where near 'political civility' over the last twelve months.
0,2,1,Poker face! POKER FACE!
3,1,0,Yes, our brief was brief. But funny? No.
3,1,0,I'm certain taxes will be here.
2,1,1,Your chances of acquittal are grim.
4,0,0,So we'll petition the court to vacate the ruling.
2,2,0,I like that I'm not the most unpopular person in the courtroom for once.
4,0,0,Try telling the jury I'm the ghost of holidays past.
3,1,0,No. I don't think we can argue you deserve a tax exemption.
2,1,0,We'll plead not guilty by reason of mortality.
3,0,1,What's the catch?
3,0,1,I think the best we can hope for is a hung jury.
4,0,0,The best I can get you is life without parole.
3,0,1,He's offering you life.....I'd take it.
2,1,1,You really gotta stop showing up at the scene of the crime.
3,1,0,Please try not to laugh every time they mention the death penalty.
2,2,0,May I suggest more contemporary attire once the jury has been seated..?
2,2,0,At least they can't sentence you to death.
1,2,1,They are going to ask for the you penalty
4,0,0,First impressions are important to a jury. As your lawyer, I strongly advise a suit and tie next time.
3,0,1,If you're found guilty, you'll get life.
2,2,0,It doesn't look good. They found your scythe.
3,1,0,You're exhibit A of the murder case.
4,0,0,So I went to Donald Trump's rally but I'm not the KKK. I'm with the shleppers at Seville's Holy Week parade
4,0,0,The judge thinks you're a freight risk.
4,0,0,Just say you were out of your head.
2,0,1,Next time wear a tie.
3,1,0,I take it this isn't your first offense.
2,1,1,The jury does not believe it was suicide.
3,1,0,Not to worry- if the motion fails, we can file a writ of Habeas Corpus
1,2,0,How about showing some optimism?
4,0,0,It's worse than we thought.
4,0,0,Sorry, but I think we're dead.
3,1,0,It's very important - for both of us- you learn to pronounce "mesothelioma."
3,1,0,I urge you take the plea. They could give you life.
1,2,1,Well, one thing's for certain, there's no possibility of a death penalty verdict
3,0,0,Nothing is that grim.
4,0,0,When were you going to tell me you weren't wearing your cloak ?
1,3,0,I told you not to wear your work clothes.
2,0,1,The worst sentence you could get is life.
3,1,0,Relax! There's no way they'll be able to make a positive ID.
1,2,1,You might like it on death row.
3,1,0,I though I was off the table.
4,0,0,Stop touching jurors. We can't afford another mistrial.
4,0,0,Yes, but in the legal system, you need to make them whole.
3,1,0,We'd be in better shape if you hadn't taken Scalia.
4,0,0,They're giving you a penalty, Death.
3,1,0,Really ? This again. I told you I am not going to call you Mr. Grim Reaper. Just Mr. Reaper. It works better with juries and I think is just sounds more professional.
2,2,0,No, not going well...not well at all.
2,1,1,What do you mean, you were framed ?
4,0,0,We need to find you a stronger alibi.
2,1,1,Don't worry, you can only receive the death penalty once.
3,1,0,We'll appeal if you get life.
3,1,0,Your prospects of winning are grim....unless it's a hung jury
2,2,0,You're opposed to the death sentence?
4,0,0,I'm having trouble reading your lips.
3,1,0,A little smile for the jury please Reappie.
2,2,0,Remember, it's important to make eye contact with the jury
3,1,0,I don't mean to rain on your parade, but the death penalty is serious.
2,2,0,The average age of the jury is 85. What do YOU think the chance of your getting a favorable verdict are?
4,0,0,Gimme ten minutes.
1,3,0,We may have trouble finding a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,Which jury member?
2,2,0,Maybe try smiling
3,1,0,I don't think the death penalty will be invoked.
4,0,0,The appeal is not going well either?
3,1,0,At least there's no death penalty!
2,0,2,Look kindly.
4,0,0,Look. Accepting payment obligates you to transport.
3,1,0,...on the other hand, none of the survivors can positively identify you.
2,2,0,'It was just his time' may not be our best argument.
1,1,1,Putting on a good face is critical.
3,1,0,I thought we agreed on a sweater vest and tie?
4,0,0,Please stop requesting a hung jury.
2,1,0,Shouting "Black Deaths Matter" will lose it all for us.
4,0,0,Take the plea and you're looking at life.
2,0,0,When the judge asks for a plea, just say "all in."
2,1,0,Why didn't you tell me they had an eye witness?
3,1,0,I don't believe that the Uniform Code of Grim Reaper Conduct is recognized in this jurisdiction.
3,1,0,when are you allowing strangers to this contest ? you haven't change the countries authorized
4,0,0,You're dead to me.
3,1,0,i will see if i can get you life.
2,2,0,Seriously? A hoodie?
3,1,0,Yes Mr. Reaper, this is a class action suit brought against you by the Imps of Death, for excessive withholding taxes and gross underpayment since the beginning of time.
4,0,0,Thankfully this state doesn't have the death penalty
3,1,0,Stop acting like the sky is falling. This Trump thing will pass.
2,1,0,It's an older jury. . .lose the hoody.
2,1,1,Clients don't usually ask me to argue for "Death".
3,1,0,When I said professional attire, I meant suit and tie.
2,1,0,Do you have a tie on under your hood?
4,0,0,It's not the hoodie itself that I'm worried about.
1,3,0,I fully understand that you favor the death penalty if convicted.
4,0,0,OK. I'll explain to the judge that you smell so bad that you just like to kept covered. I'm sure he'll understand.
4,0,0,I'd ask you to speak for yourself, but I see that's impossible.
3,1,0,We can try for manslaughter, but honestly, it doesn't help that you're black.
3,0,0,That's so hollow...
1,2,1,So, should we seek the death penalty?
4,0,0,No. I don't the court will let us call Beelzebub, the ruler of demons, as a witness.
4,0,0,So you know that they are asking for the death sentence
4,0,0,you gotta stop with the pop-in
4,0,0,I feel good about the jury. We were able to strike all the Blue Oyster Cult fans.
4,0,0,You're looking pretty fly.
3,1,0,Unless we can turn the tide, a life sentence is the best you're gonna get.
4,0,0,I don't think the affluenza will work here
4,0,0,Well, congratulations, you got the death penalty. But you can expect they're gonna give it the ol' college try anyway.
1,1,2,I'm afraid that could be construed as witness intimidation.
4,0,0,I've told them who you are but we live in an extremely litigious society these days.
3,1,0,Can you at least TRY to look a little less grim?
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'm going to challenge the facial recognition technology they used.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to wait until after the sentencing.
2,1,0,I guess this means that the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,You've got to lighten up and not let them see your dark side.
3,1,0,Everyone knows you're a sure thing, but these tax people have something going for them too.
4,0,0,The hoodie sure didn't help.
4,0,0,Halloween is tomorrow
2,1,0,Seriously? You have a life insurance policy?
0,3,0,It was consensual, right?
4,0,0,You had me cut my hair, shave, and put on suit, I thought you dress up for my trial!
3,1,0,I can plead you down to eternity, with a few years off for good behavior.
4,0,0,I'm going to argue that this shouldn't be a death penalty case.
4,0,0,Remember, you are innocent until proven.
4,0,0,Are you referring their homes as legal pads?
3,1,0,Anything you say may be used against you in the afterlife.
4,0,0,If you get the death penalty that means you get of scott free
4,0,0,Relax... that facial recognition software will not incriminate you.
4,0,0,Justice may be blind but the jury can see you.
3,0,0,Our only chance is a hung jury.
2,1,0,Life is certainly not on the table.
4,0,0,Just between you and me . . . did you do it?
4,0,0,Ya. I just think scythe or no scythe, you're doomed.
3,1,0,Don't worry, you said they didn't get a good look at your face.
4,0,0,They gave you death, but just don't come for yourself.
3,1,0,I made you a killer deal.
3,0,1,That's not what they mean by "hung jury."
4,0,0,...a little unusual..the judge just asked for a little more time...
4,0,0,It's 2016. They're a protected class. You should have known better.
2,2,0,The IRS will find YOU if you don't pay your taxes
3,1,0,You do understand that it is against the law to ride your horse through the center of town.
4,0,0,My best guess is the plaintiff is either suicidal, or he's looking to recover enough to pay his medical expenses. Why else would he sue you for malpractice?"
4,0,0,Apparently for you, death is not a penalty.
4,0,0,I told you yesterday that it's okay to wear white after Easter.
4,0,0,It looks grim, Reaper.
4,0,0,We've managed to avoid death row.
3,0,0,Should we cop a plea?
2,1,0,The judge is in poor health. He'll listen.
3,0,1,You're sure you want to go for the death sentence?
3,0,1,My strategy is to just buy us a little more time.
4,0,0,In this instance of identity theft, we have an excellent shot at a necessity defense
4,0,0,Well for starters, instead of leading the dearly departed to the afterlife, you took him to an After Hours Strip Club.
4,0,0,Now, whenever I object, I want you to give an innocent look to the jury.
2,1,0,I'm afraid the outlook for your case looks grim.
2,1,1,The death penalty is not an option in Traffic Court.
4,0,0,I think we can beat the murder charge, but collecting souls carries a mandatory minimum sentence in this state.
4,0,0,Don't look so grim! Reap trials almost always come down to he said, she said.
3,1,0,You can relax, it's just the death penalty.
2,1,1,I don't think you will be getting a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're gonna go with the death penalty.
2,1,0,First time in probate court?
4,0,0,I've been hoodwinked!
4,0,0,You do understand you're looking a life sentence.
3,0,0,It looks like a hung jury.
4,0,0,Relax. You've overcome even the worst-case scenario.
3,1,0,Any last words?
2,1,1,I cannot file to declare you dead until you pay my retainer.
0,4,0,Don't worry, it only feels like eternity.
1,2,0,Don't look any juror in the eye. And it would help if you could be a little less grim.
3,0,0,I’m sorry. I thought you would be okay with pleading to the death penalty.
3,0,0,If any of your past is found admissible, you'll have to take a plea.
1,3,0,Remember, let me do all of the talking
3,0,1,You are the last client I will take on before my retirement.
3,1,0,You realize that the death penalty isn't available in civil cases, don't you?
3,0,1,It's about who you didn't kill.
3,1,0,Ironically, they want to give you life.
2,2,0,I don't understand. YOU are the statute of limitations.
2,1,0,We'll plead self-defense.
3,1,0,Face it Grim ... they can see through you
2,1,0,Try smiling.............it may make you look a little less grim.
3,1,0,Stop pointing at the jurors. We're running out of alternates.
4,0,0,I wont lie to you..things look pretty grim. Do you have something else you could wear to court?
3,1,0,Maybe you should wear something else to court.
4,0,0,You shouldn't worry. The worst you can get is death.
4,0,0,Yours is the grimmest case I've ever taken.
3,1,0,Somehow I don't see them going for the death penalty in this case.
4,0,0,If the hoodie does not fit, they will NOT acquit!
3,1,0,Describe your occupation as "end of retirement advisor"
1,1,1,Looks like they've got you dead to rights.
4,0,0,We have to convince the jury that you're not a serial killer.
1,0,2,Good news. It's the death sentence.
1,1,1,No I don't think "Self Defence" would be a good angle.
3,0,1,I'm afraid they may sentence you to life.
4,0,0,Am I looking at the death penalty?
4,0,0,It's a slam dunk. This state has no death penalty.
3,1,0,Try to put your best face on this.
4,0,0,It was a senseless death - we'll just plead insanity.
3,1,0,Our defense is mistaken identity.
2,1,0,Not a problem. Your scythe tested clean.
3,1,0,I like your brief.
4,0,0,I think the best we can hope for is life.
4,0,0,This will go a lot easier if you would stop smiling like you're going to kill someone.
3,0,1,You can take that off now. They 've taken the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Put on a happy face.
2,1,0,Knock off the "Your time is at hand". A simple "yes or no your honor" is enough.
2,2,0,We have a chance..they can't find your scythe.
3,0,0,Tommorrow - less eyeshadow.
2,1,1,You know, the prosecution makes a pretty good point.
2,1,0,I suppose it's inevitable that you became a tax lawyer.
4,0,0,Legally, doing every other death ever doesn't mean you did this one.
2,0,1,I thought we agreed that you were going to wear a suit today.
4,0,0,Wait, define "disorderly conduct."
4,0,0,It's going to be tough—the IRS is as certain of their case as we are of ours.
3,0,0,I'm afraid Death's still on the table.
4,0,0,I recommend you plead the fifth.
0,3,1,We can get a reduced sentence if you snitch on the big guy.
2,1,0,I said dark coat, not dark cloak, Mr. Daggert.
4,0,0,You're doing great. You have the jury in the palm of your hand.
1,1,0,The whole AARP chapter filed a no contact order against you.
3,0,1,Well at least death is off the table.
2,2,0,We're going to go for everlasting life.
3,1,0,Good news! The Prosecutor said the death penalty is off-the-table.
4,0,0,At least you don't have to worry about getting the death penalty.
4,0,0,I recommend you take the plea bargain
4,0,0,Stop, stop. . . he said griM, not griN.
3,0,0,Don't mention The Maiden.
3,1,0,It was inevitable that one day you'd be sued for censoring someone's Facebook post.
3,0,0,I don't care what you have on your business cards, for this trial you will be known as Billy Reaper.
3,0,0,When you take the stand, tell them how the whole thing left you mortified.
3,0,0,"GUESS WHO?" IS NOT A NAME!
4,0,0,You're dead in this case.
3,1,0,You're just an empty suit.
4,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
2,1,0,Is it possible to lose the hoodie? The jurors can't relate to you.
3,0,1,What do you mean who's taking over the case once I'm gone?
4,0,0,We'll get more from them this time, I promise.
4,0,0,I realize your a Public Defender, but could you at least dress more optimistically?
4,0,0,No, I'm only 30, I've just billed 99 years of work to my clients.
3,0,0,''You need to wipe the smile off your face.''
4,0,0,Juries tend to be lenient given short life expectancy, which puts you in a strong position.
3,1,0,I think I'd lose the hoodie - it comes across as anti-social.
2,2,0,I think you should try losing the hoodie.
4,0,0,Admit nothing! We allow their souls to wander the earth, and your back in the death game. Deal? No need to shake on it.
4,0,0,That is not what I meant when I told you to dress conservatively.
2,0,1,I am just not sure that it is a good idea for you to take the stand in your own defense
4,0,0,Never mind taking the fifth. Just keep answering "NEVERMORE". A dozen of those and they will be eager for you to leave.
4,0,0,I think we'd do better with this jury if you could lose your head scarf.
4,0,0,Sorry. The judge said 'No' to chess.
2,1,0,Do you have any character witnesses?
4,0,0,"Technically they aren't your peers, but at least they're all seniors.
4,0,0,Here's the good news: you got the death penalty.
4,0,0,Not good,. She ID'd you.
3,0,0,I find your argument to be somewhere between rather grim and somewhat empty.
4,0,0,The bad news, it's the death sentence. The good news, they can't find anyone to do it.
3,1,0,Reading the indictment, I was chagrined to learn your first name isn't 'Graham', Mr. Reaper.
3,0,1,We'll convince the jury that "wrongful" is hate speech.
3,1,0,Just so we are clear, you want me to argue in favor of the death penalty. Is that correct?
2,1,1,And you're absolutely sure it was his time...right?
3,0,1,Just look at the bright side. If you get a life sentence you can go to the beach.
3,0,1,Just hang in there. A slap on the wrist, collect your scythe from the evidence drawer, and you'll be on your way
3,0,0,That death penalty joke was too arrogant and did not help our case
4,0,0,Lose the hoodie, it might give them the wrong idea
2,1,0,I'm going to argue that you are a victim of profiling.
4,0,0,What exactly do you mean by 'a more hands-on approach'?
2,1,1,Remind the jury that you also killed Hitler.
4,0,0,I think we can assume the death penalty is out.
3,1,0,You should be worried. Judge Hatcher just lost his wife.
2,2,0,You're right--it's pointless to try to get the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,Perhaps don't mention the 107 billion people you've killed.
3,1,0,The judge doesn't want you approaching the bench for any reason.
4,0,0,We're gonna have to work on your image.
3,0,1,A life sentence might cramp your style.
3,1,0,Hung jury is supposed to be a metaphor.
2,1,1,Juries can be tough on repeat offenders.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, I've already taken the Fifth Century !
4,0,0,Really? You couldn't have shown up before I got indicted?
3,0,1,Remember, if they ask for whom the bell tolls, take the fifth.
3,0,0,Well, looks like this case will be the death of me.
3,1,0,I think the death penalty is our best option.
2,2,0,Ok good news: she gets the house, but you get the Anne Geddes Calendar collection
3,1,0,I'm assuming that jail time isn't an issue?
3,0,1,Insanity is okay, but inevitability will get you life.
3,1,0,Yes, I do see the irony of having to appear in tax court.
4,0,0,It would be going better if you'd stopped tweeting during the trial.
4,0,0,Give me back my daughter, just for one more day
3,1,0,I advise you to take the deal. Otherwise, you risk getting life.
4,0,0,Rumor has it they are concerned about executing the death penalty
2,1,1,You don't have anything else you can wear?
3,1,0,We're unlikely to get parole, given your record...
3,1,0,I'll be frank, your odds are grim.
4,0,0,Is it too late to ask you where you went to law school?
2,1,1,Is there anything between the Black Death and World War II you're not telling me about.
1,2,0,You should have worn the nice blue suit I got for you and ditched the hoodie.
2,2,0,Legally changing your name will not alter people's perception of you.
4,0,0,There's no witness protection program if you turn state's evidence against God.
3,0,1,Ok, now try to look alive during the cross examination.
4,0,0,You promised I'd win...
3,0,0,I think I can get the judge to agree to a 10-to-life sentence.
4,0,0,If you loose, you get life.
4,0,0,WE COULD PLEA BARGAIN FOR LIFE
3,0,1,Is there something about losing a chess game that you didn't tell me about?
3,1,0,Remember, it was self-defense.
2,1,0,Would it be fair to say you made a killing on your wife's life insurance?
2,1,0,Remember, what happened in the hood stays in the hood.
3,1,0,I say loose the hoodie.
2,1,0,Not only you should take the fifth, but all twelve of them.
3,1,0,I think, in your case, we're going to have a tough time avoiding the death penalty.
3,1,0,I've represented worse.
4,0,0,Sorry, the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,Now? Seriously? ... Boo who?
4,0,0,Don't look so grim,We can always appeal.
4,0,0,Our goal here today is to remind the jury that you are just the messenger and guide - not the perpetrator.
4,0,0,My suit had blood on it.
4,0,0,If you don't take the plea, you could be looking at a life sentence.
4,0,0,If only I could get a sign... any kind of sign.
4,0,0,I think we're okay, we've got 3 Zombies on the Jury
4,0,0,I don't think we're going to make it to trial.
3,1,0,No, I don't think the witness is looking a little old.
2,1,1,Juror #4 is asking that you stop staring at her like that.
3,0,0,I'm going to go with the "Acquit or it will be Grim" argument.
3,0,1,‘No Lives Matter’ won’t hold up in court.
4,0,0,My colleagues get a little suspicious sometimes
3,1,0,Any chance tomorrow you can wear the plaid outfit , you are scaring the jury
4,0,0,I'm glad you didn't bring your scythe.
4,0,0,You are sure to win, it's a tax case.
2,0,1,You wait until now to tell me you did do it!
4,0,0,Remember that you're here because Adam and Eve were disobedient.
2,1,0,I said do not wear your work clothes.
3,0,1,Laughing when the judge says death sentence? Not our best move.
2,1,1,In my 20 years of litigation you're my first client who WANTS the death penalty.
4,0,0,No I am sure you can't seek the death penalty for a parking violation
4,0,0,Try to tone it down. I don't think yelling 'I'll see you in hell' at the prosecutor is going to help your case.
2,1,0,Try to put on a happy face.
4,0,0,It is time for a new defense strategy. I think you are sending the jury the wrong message.
4,0,0,Apparently your scythe is not deductible.
3,1,0,You're finished, they found the scythe.
0,3,1,For the next two weeks, I'm going to need less grim.
4,0,0,hey whats up
3,0,0,Let's face it. Your future looks rather bleak.
3,1,0,Let's put it this way: The scythe of justice cuts slowly, but it cuts really deep ...
4,0,0,You're kidding, right?
4,0,0,Remember, you're to say that you were on holiday.
2,2,0,Opposing counsel is willing to cut a deal...his mother-in-law lives at 42 Maple Lane.
2,0,0,Nothing is certain, Mr. Death, but taxes.
4,0,0,Grim reaping is punishable by death.
3,0,0,Settle? I don't think Mr. Webster stands a chance!
3,0,0,"Maybe you shouldn't wear that on the witness stand." '
4,0,0,I've researched your case thoroughly and find that I can no longer defend your actions.
2,0,1,The death penalty is off the table since you are not an MD, and thus not qualified to perform assisted suicide.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I think I can get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,The good news is that they decided to take the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,I'm already on the dark side
2,1,0,At least we don't need to worry about the death penalty.
3,0,0,Their case is mostly circumstantial.
0,3,1,A hung jury, Mr. Reaper, is not what you think it is.
3,0,0,You sure you won't change your mind about wearing that suit and tie I brought for you?
4,0,0,You're black and wearing a hoodie -- you haven't got a chance of acquittal
4,0,0,You must testify that he died of supernatural causes.
4,0,0,I think I can get them to drop the charge down to Man slaughter.
3,0,0,You may be able to walk out of here with just a point of the wrist.
4,0,0,Of course, if we win this one, we may find it to be a hollow victory.
2,1,0,There is no 'other' venue!
3,0,0,If they can't produce a sickle, I think we're good.
2,2,0,It seems the witnesses are all deceased.
2,1,1,Remember, he was already dead when you got there.
1,1,0,Remember, you can't reap while under oath.
3,0,0,Life, of course.
3,1,0,You should be happy the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,1,Yeah, but they'll kill you on cross.
3,1,0,I think we can avoid the 'you' penalty.
3,1,0,Yes, I realize that hoodies are really in style now so it could have been someone else.
4,0,0,What do you mean the sickle is the under the desk?
4,0,0,Yes, I'm sure 'absence of malice' will not be effective here!
3,1,0,Remember to smile and look the jury right in the eye.
4,0,0,Ok, I get it. She did kill her lover with the candelabra in the library!
4,0,0,Yes, I definitely recommend taking the 5th!
3,0,1,I don't care if it was his time, do not kill any more of the jurors.
1,2,1,This case is dead on arrival.
3,0,0,Didn't I tell you to lose the hoodie for the trial?
4,0,0,No need to worry Prime Minster Camaron. This is just the hearing for the Panama Papers.
4,0,0,Don't worry, you're safe! They used facial recognition software.
4,0,0,Your case is looking pretty grim, Reaper
3,0,1,I wouldn't worry about the death penalty because, well, you know.
4,0,0,Remember, Mr Reaper, if anyone asks God is NOT dead.
1,2,0,I think it's best you don't testify.
2,1,1,It would help if your alibi didn't involve killing other people.
4,0,0,I don't think we're going to get much traction arguing that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.
1,2,1,Relax, you had to leave your scythe at the metal detector. Now, you're just a random guy in a hoodie.
3,0,1,Good news; you're getting death.
2,0,2,That's not what Jury nullification means.
4,0,0,Should I ask for the death penalty?
3,0,0,Easier than getting OJ off.
3,0,1,"Death comes for us all" is not a good defense.
4,0,0,I'll give you $10,000 if you read off this pad and whisper something in my ear during the trial.
2,0,1,Any prior convictions?
3,1,0,Yes, I get it, our case is dead.
3,1,0,Our prospects look grim Mr. Reaper...I don't think the jury is buying the 'Angel of Death/River Styx' defense.
4,0,0,Without the scythe, they're just pointing fingers too.
3,1,0,Lawyer: I kept telling you, there are only two things certain in this life. You should have just paid your taxes, this is how they got Blade.
4,0,0,You brought the wrong folder - these are just a bunch of death certificates.
3,0,0,Mr. Trump had to blame someone for killing his campaign!
2,2,0,I can get the death cases thrown out, but tax evasion....
4,0,0,I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but would it have hurt you to put on a tie?
3,0,0,I'd say looks rather grim right now Mr. Reaper.
3,1,0,Things are looking a bit grim.
2,1,0,Don't look so glum. If you get life, I'm sure we'll win on appeal.
3,1,0,The stages here are similar to what you're used to seeing. Deny everything, argue, plea bargain, but ultimately accept the verdict.
4,0,0,Surely you'll get something less than the death penalty."
2,1,0,It won't be life or the death sentence, so I'm not entirely sure what we're doing here.
4,0,0,The jury is death-qualified.
3,1,0,So, I assume you want the death penalty.
4,0,0,I suggest we plead diminished reaponsibility.
3,1,0,No, you can't reap a hung jury.
2,1,0,Take. The. Stand.
4,0,0,...and I don't want to hear your version of Dry Bones when you're on the stand.
3,1,0,I'm dead if I lose this, right?
4,0,0,Personally, I like your outfit. Not sure about the jury.
3,1,0,With 107,602,707,791 counts of manslaughter against you, I recommend you take the plea bargain.
4,0,0,In this case I'll be referring to you as "my client". Mr. Death may not play well with the jury.
2,2,0,Seriously, don't worry about this. Trump sues everybody.
3,1,0,Please, no jury tampering.
3,1,0,Try not to look proud.
3,1,0,What do you think of a first impression?
4,0,0,When they call you to the witness stand, you want to be a little bit more forthcoming.
3,0,0,Stop saying, "Reap 'em and weep."
2,2,0,I always knew this job would kill me.
4,0,0,I'm telling you it's a fair trade. I put this guy on death row, you give me 15 - 20 more years.
4,0,0,I got you a backstage pass to the Justin Bieber concert.
3,1,0,Good news. The prosecutor agreed to the death penalty.
3,0,1,Relax, we've been through this billions of times.
4,0,0,In our State they've abolished the death penalty.
4,0,0,The Devil made you do it? That could be a defense!
0,3,1,I think our best strategy is to argue that you were just the messenger.
3,1,0,With all due respects ,Community service at the funeral home is your only option.
1,1,1,If they give you a life sentence, try not to laugh.
4,0,0,Your brother is not feeling well and he sent you?
3,0,1,I advise that you don't take the stand.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, the hoodie is not helping.
2,1,1,Try not to look so grim; we will file an appeal.
4,0,0,I don't think hiding the scythe is going to fool the jury.
3,0,0,Your prints were all over the scythe.
4,0,0,Deal. Pro bono, pro life.
3,1,0,Let me do the talking--I think I can get you life.
2,2,0,Try to look friendly.
3,1,0,The charge is inappropriate garb for a 40 year old.
2,1,0,I was going to ask for some time alone with my client but have changed my mind.
3,0,1,Try not to look so grim when I put you on the stand.
3,1,0,Somehow I don't think this jury is going to go for the death penalty.
3,0,1,The evidence is pretty damning.
1,3,0,The judge's ruling is that you cannot bring the scythe with you into the courtroom. It made all of the attorneys nervous, even me.
4,0,0,Now, don't say you can't remember.
3,1,0,I think you are going to have to get over your identity crisis before I put you on the stand!
4,0,0,So what say we get a cuppa coffe after this?
4,0,0,This is traffic court, there's no pleading guilty and asking for the death penalty.
2,1,1,Death becomes you.
3,1,0,Well yes, if six or more of the jurors suddenly died at the same time a mistrial would be declared, but what are the odds of that happening?
3,1,0,Finally, a proper attorney.
4,0,0,Because you're a family friend I'll do it pro bono
4,0,0,Remember, no eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,How could you even tell that the business suit you were supposed to wear to court today was one size too small?
4,0,0,At least the judge can't give you the death sentence.
4,0,0,You look like you've seen a ghost.
4,0,0,Now surprised witness isn't necessarily a bad thing. Have you wronged anyone in the last couple years?
2,1,0,I'm afraid you may have to go underground for awhile.
4,0,0,Try not to look so guilty.
4,0,0,No, this time it's about taxes.
3,1,0,Ironically, You GOT life.
3,1,0,I don't think we convinced then it was justifiable homicide.
2,1,1,Lots of people don't file their taxes, so I think their argument is moot.
3,1,0,This may result in a redundancy.
4,0,0,This is my formal hoodie.
2,2,0,I don't think "I was profiled because I was wearing a hoodie." is a winning defense.
4,0,0,We'll talk about the tunnel next week.
4,0,0,im telling you, she was dead before i got there
3,0,1,Hey one to two millennia beats life.
3,0,0,Don't worry. If you get the death penalty, we'll get it reversed on appeal.
4,0,0,I think you're looking at life.
3,0,1,What do you mean by jury of your peers?
3,1,0,The real trick will be proving to the millennials that you're not a Dementor.
1,3,0,You having nothing to worry about. The witness never saw your face.
4,0,0,I am afraid you are looking at life without parole...
3,0,0,It doesn't matter, they've got your fingerprints.
4,0,0,Remember on the question of your innocence your response is; "I'm dead right"
3,1,0,Just try to not smirk or roll your eyes under cross examination.
3,0,0,You're dead to me for the work you make me do.
2,1,1,The "alleged" destroyer of worlds, OK?
3,1,0,Yes--I'm pretty certain you needed to pay taxes.
3,0,1,To be honest, I'd be surprised if you get life.
4,0,0,You want me to ask the judge for a brief delay in the proceedings because you may have left your kitchen light on?
3,0,0,No one seems to know why or by whom Judgment Day was capitalized in the statute.
3,0,0,No of course I'm not going to put a Trappist monk on the stand.
4,0,0,It may be a little grim, but we are taking this one to the grave.
4,0,0,You bet the Devil, on who' s a better lawyer?
4,0,0,What happened to my straw man?
4,0,0,No, I don't think calling The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as character witnesses is a good idea.
2,2,0,Perhaps you don't understand. In your case the death penalty is considered a punishment.
3,0,0,What do you mean this IS your most professional look?
4,0,0,I've had this judge before. Copyright infringement on the phrase 'Death Penalty' is totally winnable.
2,1,1,And then you say, "Tobacco? What's that?"
3,1,0,Looks like they're seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,They don't take kindly to hoodies in the courtroom.
4,0,0,I think leaving your scythe in the cloakroom was a smart move.
4,0,0,Yea, I know, kind of ironic – they’re pushing for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Avoid eye contact with the jurors
2,1,0,Is this a me penalty state?
1,3,0,I told you that black hoodies don't play well with juries.
4,0,0,Joe, let's face it. Uh, let me re phrase that
4,0,0,Suppose I plead guilty to taxes.
2,2,0,Relax, try not to look so grim.
2,2,0,The jury will see your humanity once they look into your… um…
1,2,0,'Just doing my job' is no defense.
4,0,0,Let's hope justice is blind.
4,0,0,Maybe if you pull the hood back you'll appear less demonic to the jury.
3,1,0,Statistically speaking, your odds are pretty good.
2,2,0,They're not buying our "first time offender" plea.
3,1,0,"Self-defence" may be a very tough sell.
4,0,0,I hope we get a liberal jury.
4,0,0,Think now: "this isn't the verdict we were looking for"
3,1,0,Relax—this judge is on record as being against the death penalty.
2,1,0,I'm not sure, but I don't think the judge likes dire prophecies.
4,0,0,You don't have to worry about the death sentence.
4,0,0,I think I can convince the jury that the Grim Reaper owns the rights to the hoodie.
3,1,0,They offered us a plea deal: Parole without life.
3,0,1,You're making jury selection rather difficult.
1,2,0,In your case, capital punishment may not apply
2,1,0,No, no...it's the other way around: stare at the prosecutor, not the jury.
4,0,0,Remember short answers and try not to smile
4,0,0,No, I think we can plea it down to a life sentence.
3,1,0,Because you're death, witness protection is out of the question.
3,1,0,I don't care how many millennia you have been around or how many places you have been, only judges wear robes here now.
4,0,0,This should be a breeze - all my other clients are faceless corporations...
4,0,0,At least the death sentence is off the table.
4,0,0,Would it hurt you to wear a tie?
4,0,0,There is no way the glove's gonna fit.
3,0,0,I told you from the start, should of become a doctor.
4,0,0,Tell the judge you promise not to hang out in the old hood.
4,0,0,If we lose this case, where does that leave me?
3,0,0,We've got this. He was a known anarchist and the police have already stated that his death was "accidental"! Stop worrying! For goodness sake, he was on your doorstep!
4,0,0,You can run......but......you can't hide!
3,1,0,A lot of my clients have been profiled for wearing a hoodie.
4,0,0,Oh crap. I wasn't supposed to look you in where your face should be.
2,1,0,Stop acting so paranoid. He's reading my lips, not yours.
4,0,0,The prosecution wants the you penalty
4,0,0,You can't use that alibi. They will see right through you!
4,0,0,'I guess the death sentence isn't much of an issue for you.'
4,0,0,Why in the world would I want to plea bargain for life imprisonment?
4,0,0,I told you not to wear your hoodie to court.
2,2,0,We've discussed this already, that would be considered Jury tampering.
4,0,0,There is precedent - if the mask doesn't fit, they must acquit
4,0,0,I told you... the death penalty's off the table!
2,2,0,Tell them your part was inevitable.
3,0,1,Luckily for you, it won't be hard to find a jury of your peers in this jurisdiction.
2,1,1,The name of the penalty is purely coincidental
2,2,0,Just tell the jury that, "the devil is in the details"!
3,1,0,Mr. Reaper the possibility of aquital looks grim.
3,0,1,Life-sentence does not mean what you think it means.
4,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie when we're in trial, remember?
2,1,1,Remember, we're angling for the death penalty
3,1,0,It all comes down to facial recognition.
4,0,0,Why the blank stare?
3,0,0,Don't let him bait you.
3,0,1,"Frankly, our chances of finding someone to testify on your behalf are pretty slim".
4,0,0,The prosecution wants life.
2,0,1,I told you to wear a suit and tie during the trial
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, there's just not much we can do to soften your image.
3,1,0,The worst they can give is the you-penalty!
2,1,1,I know you invented it.
4,0,0,Not one character witness will speak in your defense?
4,0,0,Sentencing is Monday. Do you have a different outfit you can wear?
4,0,0,No I can't tell them your sickle is a tool of the trade.
2,2,0,I don't think they'll go for a "life" sentence in your case.
3,0,0,Why are you hiding?
4,0,0,Trust me. If anyone has standing as a sovereign citizen, it's you!
3,1,0,That outfit isn't helping your case.
1,2,0,I can't stop them from referring to it as a penalty.
3,1,0,And, naturally, your taxes.
3,1,0,So if I win this case, I'm off the hook?
3,1,0,You look awfully grim.
2,1,0,Grim, you've done it again. You're in the wrong courtroom. This is traffic court and that outfit has to go.
2,2,0,Without the scythe or a pale horse they don't have a prayer.
1,2,1,She wants the house, 3,500,000,000 souls, and the dog.
3,1,0,I think we have a pretty good shot at a mistrial. You're scaring the crap out of the jurors.
1,2,1,I know it's ironic, but they're giving you life.
2,2,0,I think I can get you the death penalty.
4,0,0,You seem to be making Juror #3 very nervous.
2,1,1,In your case, the death penalty is a winning situation.
4,0,0,I'll do the objecting. Stop with the sulfur.
4,0,0,I'm not the one on trial here.
4,0,0,If we don't like how it's going, let's strike the jury.
3,1,0,Will you be involved with jury selection?
3,1,0,I don't think taking the Fifth would help. Your track record is pretty well documented.
2,2,0,It's all come down to the eyewitness.
3,0,1,They've asked you to take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,I guess, this is it.
4,0,0,Let's ask for the death sentence. It's our only chance to retain any control of the outcome.
2,1,1,Can I get an extension?
3,1,0,So, then, I won't be given liberty.
3,1,0,I told you to wear a suit.
4,0,0,"Your rhyming attorney says 'since you have no face, we have no case' ".
4,0,0,They agree to drop the weapons charge if you plea to the lesser, failure to appear in court.
3,0,0,I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the Grim Reaper clause.
2,1,0,No, the glove defense has already been used.
4,0,0,Ready, Mr. Durst?
4,0,0,Remember to let the jurors see your loveable side.
3,1,0,I know you're trying to make a point here, but we really should have settled out of court.
3,1,0,If you plead guilty, I think we can get you life.
1,2,0,You do know "kill me now" is just a figure of speech, right?
4,0,0,Stop pointing at the witnesses.
2,1,1,Please....no more jokes about a 'hung jury'.
2,0,0,The Judge is not buying the "wheat farmer" story.
3,0,1,You would be too grim on the stand.
3,1,0,Uh, what are you doing here?
3,0,0,They found you guilty on all 3 billion counts.
3,0,1,I told you to lose the hoodie It screams guilty.
3,1,0,Yes, let's go with Fred, the "Grim Reaper" isn't likely to illicit much sympathy with the jury.
2,2,0,That's not really a fitting punishment for jay walking.
3,1,0,I was thinking maybe life without parole
2,1,1,The judge says no hoodies.
2,1,1,I'm not worried about the Grim Reaper thing, I'm worried about the hoodie.
2,1,1,Just don't touch me until after the verdict is read.
4,0,0,Yes. Getting the Death Penalty would be ironic.
3,1,0,I advise to lose the hood and plead the fifth.
4,0,0,"But they said it was a killer deal of a lifetime?
3,1,0,I don't think we have to worry about them seeking the death penalty
3,1,0,Our best bet is a hung jury.
3,0,1,Pretrial focus groups found your outfit off-putting.
3,1,0,Well you knew what they say about death and taxes...
4,0,0,Just FYI - threatening to eat the souls of the jury usually doesn't go over too well.
4,0,0,I came to take your life.
3,0,1,Even with a consecutive life sentence, you'll be out in a day.
4,0,0,What will actually happen if I don't file by April 15?
3,0,0,You don't understand: you've run out of your retainer.
4,0,0,Just watch what you say, you have that guilty look.
3,1,0,Don't be so grim, the jury is still out.
4,0,0,How shall I introduce you to as, to the Judge and Jury, "Meet Joe Black?" As to the charges against you: "Your Honor, may I ask the charges be dropped due to mistaken identity?
2,0,2,Juror 3 won't be back after lunch?
3,1,0,I'll argue that when the defendant claimed "Life's a bitch and then you die," she entered into a contract.
1,1,2,The judge strikes the jurors, not you.
4,0,0,I'm going underground until this blow's over.
3,0,0,The judge is hoping you will take the death penalty off the table.
2,2,0,No, the District Attorney won't take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,I think we can dodge the death penalty on the grounds of "cruel and unusual".
3,1,0,If you're willing to roll on heart disease I think I can get you a deal.
3,1,0,Twelve across, five letters. Opposite of life.
2,2,0,So, you WANT the death penalty?
4,0,0,They won't take the death penalty off the table, the sentence may be suicide.
3,1,0,Would you take a life sentence?
4,0,0,Yes, they've 'produced the bodies.'
4,0,0,The best they can do is murder 2. You are looking at 5 to 10.
3,1,0,Some bad news, your alibi is alive.
1,2,1,I understand but you guys can't double park seven horses in this city!
2,2,0,You have to stop killing the testifiers.
4,0,0,Hey, good news, you got the death sentence !
4,0,0,I usually recommend a Mona Lisa smile during questioning, but in your case I think a nice wide grin will work to your advantage.
2,1,1,As your lawyer, I recommend the death penalty.
3,1,0,Tomorrow, wear the suit and tie.
4,0,0,We'll try to get a postponement due to a death in every family.
3,0,0,Can we lighten the face to highlight your inner innocence ?
3,1,0,Try not to look like a death threat.
4,0,0,I know you love Halloween, Phil, but really?
4,0,0,You should have picked out a different colored hoodie.
4,0,0,If you don't testify, you might get the death penalty.
4,0,0,Human Blackhole transcends cosmic blackhole. If don't agree then check with OJSimson!
4,0,0,The lawyer replied, 'You said you feel like you are having a panic attack?'
3,1,0,The good news is the prosecutor's taken the death penalty off the table
3,1,0,Don’t look so grim, the verdict isn’t in.
3,1,0,Well, at least you're not grim.
3,1,0,Sorry, I just got this case. Do you have any character witnesses?
4,0,0,Yes, I suppose the death penalty would be redundant.
2,2,0,For jury selection, we're going to want to find people who are more afraid of public speaking than they are of you.
4,0,0,They're asking for 10 to 20, but I think we can bargain them up to death.
4,0,0,Yes, but Beelzebub's DNA is on the scythe, Mr. Grim."
2,1,1,With your history of priors, I have to advise you to take the plea.
1,2,1,On the good side, nobody can identify you for sure.
3,1,0,Do you think you could do anything about juror number 3?
3,1,0,They said they found your DNA on the scythe.
3,1,0,I'm so sorry, I know what a life sentence means to you.
3,1,0,You know you are not doing yourself any favor by wearing a hoodie to court.
3,1,0,I'm not sure that wearing a tie would help.
3,1,0,I need your optimism here.
4,0,0," Listen Grimm, the Law clearly states that you sew what you Reap "!
3,1,0,Okay ... I'll put you on the stand, but leave the Judge alone.
4,0,0,I'm a homicide lawyer, it's dark stuff.
3,1,0,Isn't the death penalty technically suicide?
3,1,0,They're leaning toward the death penalty.
4,0,0,If you don't tell them it was God's will, they are going to pin this rap on you.
4,0,0,Go easy on the deal you made with Trump.
4,0,0,This isn't a good time to bring up your taxes.
1,2,1,"It was his time," is not technically an affirmative defense.
4,0,0,Enough with this alias stuff. No one's gonna believe you're the Grime Reaper.
3,1,0,Could you try looking a little less grim?
3,0,1,Remember, call it the "Estate Tax."
1,3,0,On the bright side, your priors are inadmissible.
3,1,0,Stop looking at the jury.
1,2,0,Wear a suit and tie tomorrow, okay?
4,0,0,Wait, am I paying alimony for as long as she lives or as long as I live?
1,2,0,Remember, you were just the lackey who delivered fresh souls to Satan. Eternal damnation was his idea.
3,0,0,So, how is Terry? In case you wonder, this is a reference to Terry Prachet.
3,1,0,Look, I'm sorry but they don't HAVE the death penalty in New York.
4,0,0,Those law school loans are killing me!
4,0,0,Sorry, Senator Wasserman there simply is no affirmative defense for the alleged charges of rape in 1st-20th degree of the DNC stewardship of the 2016 Democratic nomination! process!
3,1,0,We're going to make them identify you on the stand.
1,2,1,Get serious; you're up against the IRS. Take the deal.
3,0,0,Stop worrying. The worst you can get is 'life'.
3,1,0,If the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
3,0,0,Our case is built upon the premise the jury will take you at face value, you'll have to get rid of the hoodie.
4,0,0,No! I'm not pushing for the death penalty - you always want that!
3,0,0,Chill out. He wrote a book and three short stories.
3,0,1,Bad news, you could get life.
4,0,0,Are you sure that you're not the killer?
4,0,0,Make sure you put that bag of Skittles away in your pocket before you leave this courtroom.
4,0,0,I don't want to harp on this, so to speak, but your hoodie is sending the wrong message.
4,0,0,What do you mean you have something to confess?
1,2,1,I'll probably get a death sentence again.
2,1,0,No, no, don't you see? We cannot use a writ of habeas corpus.
3,1,0,Just play dead - I'll do all the talking..
4,0,0,"After you testify it’s witness protection with a new identity as an Italian geriatric nurse?
4,0,0,Here ye reap what ye sow.
3,0,1,Habeas Corpus not Rigor Mortis
3,1,0,This IS what I wear to work.
4,0,0,Honestly, that scythe at the scene belonged to the 94 year old paraplegic.
4,0,0,For the appeal, I'd suggest you wear a suit and tie.
2,1,1,We'd have a better chance if your last name wasn't Penalty.
3,1,0,i know your past shouldn't prejudice the jury, but don't count on it.
3,1,0,Just when did you first realize that you were dead?
4,0,0,I want your answers upbeat and lively.
3,1,0,Are you listening to what I am saying?
4,0,0,What did you say your rate was again?
4,0,0,This is pretty serious. It's either going to be eternity in prison or the living penalty.
4,0,0,Please speak up. I can't read your lips
4,0,0,You are in a "juxtaposition" this state banned the death penalty
3,1,0,No, sorry. The death penalty does not mean you get to choose.
4,0,0,I told you, the jury hates hoodies!
3,1,0,Hey, it's called reasonable doubt.
3,0,0,Well as a matter of fact, it is a capital offense."
3,1,0,I strongly advise that you accept the plea bargain.
1,1,2,I'll open with Dante.
2,1,0,Let me get this straight - you would like me to _ask_ for the death penalty?
4,0,0,You can't take a holiday--your trial starts tomorrow.
2,2,0,I know its your image - but you have to ditch the hoodie!
4,0,0,The judge said the death penalty is an option.
4,0,0,It's an all white jury. Lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,I have an interest in your counsel, but is your counsel in my interest?
3,0,1,Stop looking so happy when they discuss a possible death sentence.
3,0,0,Bad news. They've taken the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,How does death in prison without parole sound?
4,0,0,You're right, no one seems favorably disposed to your actions.
2,2,0,I don't think that,'It was his time', is an adequate defense.
3,0,1,Would it have killed you to wear a tie and jacket?
4,0,0,If we plea, we can avoid the life penalty.
4,0,0,They will be seeking the death penalty
4,0,0,The good news is: they don't really have anything on you.
3,1,0,I told you to wear the blue suit.
2,1,1,Sorry buddy, I think you're getting life.
4,0,0,Its looking pretty grim Mr. Reaper "
2,1,0,It's a you penalty case.
2,1,0,We can always say you had a tough childhood
2,0,1,Do you have any dark secrets you'd like to share?
3,1,0,You know, there are a lot of people who want you dead.
2,1,0,If you want the jury's sympathy, try no to look so grim.
4,0,0,A recess because you "have a 2:00?" Seriously?
3,0,1,It was worth a shot, but I don't think the jury is buying you as "The Gracious Reaper".
4,0,0,You're looking at life, max. Assisted suicide is illegal in this state.
4,0,0,Look, I'll do my best, but you should have paid your taxes.
3,1,0,What about juror no. 666?
3,1,0,Be not proud. Take the fifth.
4,0,0,The judge has just told me that when sentencing you he needs to take into account the other one hundred billion cases of murder
3,1,0,Mister Death, even you have to pay your taxes.
2,1,1,Death penalty? You'll be fine.
4,0,0,I'm going to try to get him to waive the death penalty but you'll have to plead guilty to aggravated assault with a sickle.
3,1,0,It's a class action - Everybody in the World against You. No worries.
3,0,1,So ... worst-case scenario. What are we looking at here?
3,0,0,I don't think we should put you on the stand
2,1,0,No, I'm afraid we can't use Faust as a character witness.
2,1,0,We're going to go with an identity theft defense.
1,1,1,Not to worry. Your face doesn't show up on any of the security cameras.
4,0,0,I'm sorry vicarious liability doesn't apply in murder cases
2,2,0,I’m sorry, I can’t object every time someone implies that murder is bad.
4,0,0,If your willing to remove the cloak I may be able to get you parolled in a few weeks based on time served.
0,1,3,Good news: you may get life.
1,2,1,The judge will let you off if you "visit" his wife tonight.
1,3,0,I'll do my best, but you may be looking at life.
1,2,1,This outfit is not helping our case!
4,0,0,I'm dead serious...
3,0,0,Scythe or sickle?
2,2,0,You will be less threatening to the jury without the hoodie.
3,1,0,So wait, you're saying you're not a Dementor?
4,0,0,If you were merely a witness to his death we could make a plea bargain, but his family is sure you did it. (edited)
2,1,0,I thought you were just absent-minded
3,1,0,Remember - we're going for Harmless Reaper.
4,0,0,Been a pro-bono prosecutor very long?
3,1,0,So what was it like working with Ingmar Bergman?
4,0,0,When they ask you to state your name, plead the Fifth.
3,1,0,They're asking for life.
4,0,0,This North Carolina, they will be seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,I think there's a good chance you'll get life.
3,1,0,Didn't I specifically tell you to wear dress attire and definitely no hoodies.
3,1,0,We're not going with- "If you're the Angel of Death, it's what you do" defense!
3,1,0,The theory of our case is that he cheated death and he needs to pay for the cheating.
4,0,0,You're accused of committing a faceless crime.
4,0,0,Your wardrobe choice tells me that you don’t fully grasp the death penalty laws in this state.
3,1,0,I never thought I'd be litigating MY OWN wrongful death case!
3,1,0,Are you sure you're disclosing everything?
1,1,0,I find it interesting that you call me an "empty suit."
4,0,0,If you plead guilty, they'll wipe the points and you'll only have to pay a fine.
3,0,1,No, multiple death sentences does not mean that you just write a paragraph.
2,1,0,Try not to come off as arrogant, evasive, or dead.
4,0,0,Calling yourself grime reaper doesn't help, either.
4,0,0,well, at least you're not the devil.i would not like to negotiate any business deals with him.
2,2,0,No fingerprints on the sickle, right?
4,0,0,Yes, but in a murder trial you're a penalty not just a fact of life.
4,0,0,And remember, I've never had a client with a rap like yours.
3,0,1,Must it always be the death penalty?
3,1,0,You're free to go. There's no Death sentence in New York.
3,0,0,Do what I told you and I'm sure we can avoid the you penalty.
2,2,0,I told you the scythe wouldn't make it past security.
2,1,1,I still don't think you'd enjoy death row.
2,2,0,Apparently, the court is having a problem finding unbiased jurors.
4,0,0,I don't think we'll have to worry about punitive damages.
3,0,1,Our defense is that you were hoodwinked
4,0,0,You know, I have never lost a death penalty case.
4,0,0,Frankly, I don't think you have a chance in hell of winning this claim of breach of contract for selling one's soul.
4,0,0,You are telling me that that bell tolled for me?
2,1,1,Don't worry, it's a jury of your teenage peers.
3,1,0,They have a point. Who else uses a scyth?
4,0,0,How do we plead if everything you say is a lie?
3,0,0,After we close this case, I don't want to ever see you again, got it?
4,0,0,Any chance for parole?
4,0,0,The death penalty? You were only charged with speeding.
3,1,0,Quit killing the jurors. It's a civil case.
4,0,0,face it, without your testimony, we're going to lose this case.
4,0,0,You're killing me.
3,1,0,I'm hoping for the death penalty.
4,0,0,They're seeking the life penalty
2,1,0,Don't look so grim.
1,2,1,I don't think they'll buy into the defendant having a Death wish.
2,1,0,Let me guess, you never settle either.
3,1,0,Now don't be grim, we can always appeal.
4,0,0,No, you cannot hang the jury.
4,0,0,I think we should discuss the possibility that your next stop is the twilight zone.
3,0,1,Since you're being charged with a capital offense I think I can get you released on your own recognizance.
4,0,0,Don't worry, orange is the new black.
4,0,0,She's sayin' it was just you, her, and Immortality.
2,2,0,Just remember, if the sentence is life, we can always appeal.
3,0,1,I just don't think an assisted suicide defense is going to work in your case.
3,0,1,Do your best to look innocent.
2,1,1,I contacted your list of character witnesses, but they all said "Go to hell!"
3,1,0,When you get up there, just remember to plead the scythe.
3,1,0,Look, stop grinning at the jury. It's not working.
4,0,0,You're right about no fingerprints of course, but I still think you should've worn a suit.
3,1,0,Stop interrupting me with your brainwaves.
4,0,0,No, this is not a death penalty state.
3,0,1,No, not self defense
3,0,1,I'm not going to lie. It is looking pretty grim.....
3,1,0,Well yes ... there will be hell to pay. But how much? ... and can we talk them down?
3,1,0,Unfortunately, this is not a death penalty state.
4,0,0,I'm asking for Double Indemnity.
2,1,0,Don't worry. I'll get you the death sentence.
4,0,0,It's the IRS, so you really should consider their settlement offer.
3,1,0,Don't worry, just plead guilty and you'll get a life sentence.
4,0,0,For the last time, stop referring to the jury as a "death panel."
3,1,0,Ironically, we live in a state that doesn't support your penalty.
1,1,1,"Name" will be a problem. "Occupation" will be worse.
3,0,1,What's the downside? Offer is the Death Sentence.
3,1,0,Just tell them that your favorite movie is 'Death Takes a Holiday'
4,0,0,When you say you'll be needing to get a new lawyer, I hope it's simply because I'm doing a lousy job.
3,1,0,They've violated the habeas corpses
3,0,0,Isn't there a family member here today who could run home and get you a necktie?
4,0,0,Don't worry, we can appeal the death sentence on paradoxical grounds. I thought I told you to wear a suit.
4,0,0,Do you have anything to say about your death sentence?
2,1,1,'He said that if you harvest one more juror, he's going to hold you in contempt."
4,0,0,They've got you dead to rights.
2,1,0,"No offense, you come across a little grim.".
3,1,0,Don't be so grim; you can only get life without parole.
2,1,1,The hoodie isn't helping.
1,2,0,So, you're okay with the death penalty?
3,0,0,Most people swear on the Bible, but you can just use ‘The Art of the Deal’.
4,0,0,In order to win we have to change your image!
3,1,0,I found it very difficult to find character references to defend you.
4,0,0,You come from where? "Braavos?"
4,0,0,We can't win without a body.
4,0,0,Just let me do all the talking.
3,1,0,Can you get me out of this?
3,1,0,I assure you that the death sentence is off the table!
4,0,0,I don't really know who you are.
4,0,0,Now as your lawyer I must remind you that no one gets out alive.
4,0,0,You look like murder.
3,0,0,And then I'll say, 'if the glove fit, you must acquit.'
3,1,0,I'll need a review of all 50 thousand pages.
2,1,0,I think you'll do well in the witness protection program.
2,2,0,Look, I know the Death Penalty doesn't frighten you, but I've got a reputation to defend.
2,0,1,No - they don't give the death penalty for jay walking in this state.
3,1,0,Let's plea bargain for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Because you're peerless, this charade is probably moot.
3,1,0,I think we can avoid the death penalty if you promise not to do it again.
4,0,0,Stop looking so grim and we can win this.
4,0,0,I think the hoodie sends the wrong message.
3,0,0,Don't worry...we can always get you a movie deal.
4,0,0,Replacing Garland with you was a brilliant move - we thought you might be able to "convince" Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing!
3,0,0,Here's the charge against you: Humanity accuses you of refusing to R.I.P.
3,1,0,A plea bargain?
4,0,0,Tell them it wasn't a weapon you just wanted to cut down their high grass.
4,0,0,Duck? No, I ordered chicken.
0,3,1,You could be facing life.
3,1,0,I remind you again. This is not a death penalty state.
2,2,0,You're lucky. In this state, there's no death penalty.
3,0,0,I repeat...no breath mints, no defense.
0,3,0,Let's get Juror No. 2 "removed"
3,0,1,Try to look alive on the stand.
3,1,0,I've changed my mind about a pro Bono defense.
3,0,0,They have never had someone ask for the death penalty before.
2,2,0,I know you were just doing your job,, but the judge's wife?
2,2,0,It would be counterproductive to tell the judge you know where he lives.
3,0,1,Let's go shake hands with the prosecutor.
4,0,0,Our best bet is to try to get your sentences to run concurrently.
4,0,0,They want to sentence you to life.
3,0,1,Not to worry. Celebrity defendants never get convicted.
2,1,0,Yes, they are seeking the Death Penalty and no, I don't think we need to worry.
2,2,0,But seriously, I love your work.
4,0,0,Don't worry. They may find you guilty, but you won't get the death penalty.
3,1,0,dude just play it cool, no one will think you wanted to kiss that girl
4,0,0,There's no jury alive that will convict you.
4,0,0,Lose the hoodie before the judge gets here.
4,0,0,This killing spree that they're alleging... Can you tell me how far back it goes?
3,1,0,Stop saying you want a 'hung' jury.
3,1,0,My soul? Yeah, I'm afraid the Devil got dibs on that one.
2,0,1,I know, I know, Death waits for no man. But we gotta break for lunch at some point.
4,0,0,Fine, you don't have to give me your name, just tell me who you're voting for.
3,1,0,Hopefully the judge will order sentences to run concurrently.
3,1,0,What do you mean you didn't see her?
4,0,0,Look alive.
2,1,0,Coincidence? You've identified at every crime scene!
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but "its my thing" is a defense.
3,1,0,Don't worry, they can't sentence you for life.
4,0,0,The devil you say!!
1,1,0,The best we can hope for is the death penalty.
4,0,0,It looks grim.
3,1,0,Honestly, I really don't expect this to go well.
4,0,0,What made you think "I'm gonna kill you" was an appropriate response to "How do you plea"?
4,0,0,We move for dismissal. Of the three invisible men at the scene of the crime the police brought only my client in for the line up.
4,0,0,Yeah so I don't think the jury will see it as euthanasia.
2,1,0,So how long have you been a public defender?
4,0,0,Yeah, I'm gonna need you to pull that elbow back a little.
0,1,2,No, we can't ask for the death penalty
2,1,0,Your Honor, the Defense asks the court to examine their ultimate fate
4,0,0,Even if they drop the charges you could still face a wrongful death suit in civil court.
4,0,0,I appreciate the enthusiasm, but it's going to take around 15 years and a few botched attempts first.
1,1,2,So we have to convince the state you are neither cruel nor particularly unusual.
3,0,0,Should have filed. IRS is going to make an example of you.
4,0,0,At least try to look friendly.
3,1,0,Remember to look the jury in the eye.
2,1,1,The defense rests in peace, your honour.
3,1,0,If you plead guilty, they'll drop the death sentence.
4,0,0,When the plaintiff takes the stand, try to avoid eye contact.
4,0,0,So, what's our closing argument?
4,0,0,yes... the campaign is going well
4,0,0,You're a dead ringer for the last case I lost!
1,2,0,Remember. Project a positive image for the jury.
4,0,0,Yes, chess is more thematic, but much less legally binding.
1,1,1,Just look the jurors in their eyes and they will see your point.
3,1,0,If we lose this, the judge'll recommend the life penalty.
4,0,0,You're gonna be the death of me.
1,1,0,Bad idea telling the jury ‘All will come to me in the end’
4,0,0,Maybe we should settle out of court.
4,0,0,Bad news. The scythe has your prints all over it.
3,0,1,The death penalty isn't much of a plea bargain.
3,0,0,Remember the worst they can give you is death, wait that's the bare minimum for you.
1,2,1,Now remember, he was dead when you got there.
3,1,0,It's looking kind of grim...
3,0,1,I think we'll go with the 'I was just doing my job' defense.
3,1,0,Excellent, I hope to represent you in the future… yes we do work with clients more than once.
3,1,0,I'm confident the prosecution won't be able to positively identify you.
3,1,0,"I think involuntary manslaughter is the best we can hope for".
4,0,0,Remember, never mention that scythe.
3,0,0,I'm sorry you didn't get the death penalty. I tried.
4,0,0,I have a feeling you're losing confidence in me.
3,0,1,I don't think we can find a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,It's not your fault, she was a heavy sleeper.
3,1,0,Now you want to apologize?
4,0,0,The government is willing to settle the patent infringement portion if they can continue to use your name on their drones.
3,1,0,I think I can get the line up ID thrown out.
3,1,0,I'll try to get the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,If you'd listen to my advice about death and taxes you wouldn't be here.
1,1,1,I'm going for taking the death penalty off the table. We've got a good chance with 'time served'.
4,0,0,Your the Special Investigator from the I.R.S. assign to me? Just my luck, Of course you are! Well about my Taxes.
3,1,0,I don't know what will happen if the judge sentences you to life.
3,1,0,It's a hollow victory.
4,0,0,The IRS will never collect- its either Death OR taxes.
4,0,0,Ok, my case is that unless they can come up with the scythe, there's reasonable doubt
2,2,0,I told you, lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,No, I think it’s better if you leave the hood up.
3,0,1,I think the jury bought our guilt by "professional association" argument.
2,1,0,I don't think they can produce any witnesses.
4,0,0,Don't volunteer anything about horses or Sleepy Hollow.
3,1,0,Technically, they can't give you a life sentence.
4,0,0,I'd take the plea if I were you.
2,1,1,They have you dead to rights, I'll see if we can settle.
2,2,0,You have the right to remain silent.....but NOT invisible.
4,0,0,Freezing the breathalyzer and having no blood is going to tough to explain.
3,0,0,Let's face it: your only hope is a plea for manslaughter.
4,0,0,Don't worry. I can get you off this murder charge. They have nothing on you.
3,0,1,I'm certain I can get you off the death penalty.
4,0,0,It doesn't look good. If you plead guilty, they might be merciful and only sentence you with life in prison instead of giving you the you penalty.
3,0,0,Mr. Death, as expected, they're asking for the death penalty.
2,1,0,So you're saying life without parole isn't as long as it sounds and I should just take the deal?
4,0,0,ff
4,0,0,Don't worry...the death penalty is off the table, the most you can get is life.
4,0,0,I thought we said less ghastly.
1,1,2,Obviously,the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,In re: Life v. Death
4,0,0,Try to be more upbeat when you take the stand.
3,1,0,I'm telling you, a jury won't like the hoodie.
3,0,0,Worst case scenario, you could get life
4,0,0,The jurors may be biased.
2,1,0,If you would remove that hoodie, you may be judged more leniently.
4,0,0,Don't worry, I'm a tax attorney.
3,1,0,If the judge grants class action you're done for.
2,2,0,In your case I think going for the death penalty is overkill.
4,0,0,What sort of negotiations?
2,2,0,I have a feeling the sentencing should be right up your alley.
3,0,1,When I said 'business attire' I meant a suit.
3,0,1,This judge can't seem to grasp the difference between Rape and Reap.
2,1,0,Good news: your prints weren't on the scythe.
3,0,1,We like to refer to it as "paying backward".
4,0,0,Mr. Attorney, I am top donor to: Citizens United!
4,0,0,First off, I'll only refer to you as 'Mr. Grim.'
4,0,0,Let's try and promote your good side.
4,0,0,A dark suit without a hood would have worked better.
2,1,0,Yes, Texas has no right to infringe on your business.
4,0,0,First we get the jury to like you.
3,1,0,I wouldn't mention you voted for Trump.
4,0,0,Should I play the death card?
1,1,1,It's a hung jury.
3,0,0,Just answer the question. Don't volunteer any information.
4,0,0,uh, do you like green beans?
3,1,0,Without the scythe I don't think they'll buy it.
3,1,0,Jeepers Reaper, Stop being a Creeper.
3,1,0,Let's get you clean shaven.
3,1,0,Can we discuss who people hate more after the trial is over?
3,1,0,Not all is good in the hood.
3,1,0,I told you to wear a suit today.
4,0,0,Relax, Ichabod, I'll get you off.
2,2,0,Do you think they'll sentence me to life?
4,0,0,Don't worry... They didn't have the heart to seek the life penalty.
2,1,1,They weren't able to get any prints off of the scythe.
2,1,1,But, if I plead guilty, the judge will give me 'a Life sentence.'
4,0,0,This is NOT the time to take the fifth
3,1,0,No, wearing your charcoal gray suit tomorrow is not going to fix this.
4,0,0,You don't have any lips, so let me do the talking. Let me do the talking.
4,0,0,How can I help you?
2,1,0,That special place for lawyers--I don't go there, right?
4,0,0,I'll simply explain you were just doing your job.
4,0,0,Do not plead guilty.
3,1,0,I don't think the Twinkie Defense is going to work.
3,0,0,I should have told you - it's called a 'metal detector.'
2,0,0,I would advise you to just pay the fine and quit using your current exfoliant!
4,0,0,There's precedent for identity theft .
3,0,0,The jury room is off limits. Eat you lunch at recess in the hall.
3,0,1,Yes, I'd bone D.A. Erin Reagan, too. Wait ... what do you mean by that?
4,0,0,After everything, I can't believe they indicted you for tax fraud.
1,2,0,Just out of curiosity, what's going to happen when you place your hand on the Bible?
4,0,0,Looks like you're getting You
3,0,0,The death penalty is off the table. But they're seeking 30 years to life at the circus.
2,2,0,It's not that Grim...
4,0,0,Tell me... are you absolutely certain?
3,1,0,It's tax season, make them remember that.
3,1,0,Hey, buddy. I know you were just minding your business, but they'll arrest any dark figure wearing a hoodie.
1,3,0,Tax evasion? Really? You of all people should know the certainty of taxes.
4,0,0,They're ruling out foreplay owing to your three counts of resisting a breast.
3,1,0,Yes, it's good, but 'Love and Death' is not my favorite Woody Allen movie.
3,1,0,I told you, I don't have ANY character witnesses.
2,1,1,You don't have a prayer.
4,0,0,Don't mention your occupation while you're on the stand.
3,1,0,You're making a specter of yourself.
3,1,0,"I was just following orders" isn't gonna fly.
4,0,0,My advice, Mr. Reaper, is to lose the hoodie.
3,0,1,You just can't face this, can you?
4,0,0,Quit putting the death penalty back on this table.
4,0,0,How do you feel about ankle bracelets?
2,1,0,"Be more specific, how many trillions"?
3,0,0,I know you killed him, but did you *kill him* kill him?
1,2,0,Remember, you were just the messenger.
3,0,1,I can't object. It's actually called the Death Penalty.
4,0,0,Of course security is going to take your reaper. I think the jury will recognize you anyway.
3,1,0,Would you like to meet my mother-in-law?
3,1,0,Nothing is certain but death and lawyers' fees.
2,1,0,I told you to wear a tie and jacket.
3,0,1,Yes, wearing a hoodie could hurt you with this jury, but it's your call
2,2,0,A hung jury is a win for us.
3,1,0,You're losing face!
3,1,0,No worries, prior bad acts are excluded
3,1,0,Good news. They're going for the death penalty.
1,2,1,Right now, I think the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,1,I like the new haircut!
3,0,0,Remember, our client's life is in your hands.
3,1,0,This is the one case where I advise leaving the hoodie on
4,0,0,I hate to say this, but we're probably looking at the death penalty.
1,1,1,Best case we get a hung jury
4,0,0,If the glove doesn't fit, they must acquit.
3,1,0,We may have found a loop hole with this whole "till death do us part" verbiage.
4,0,0,Sorry, no hoodies in the courtroom.
4,0,0,Defending taxes would be easier than this.
4,0,0,To be honest, I don't think we'll do well with a writ of habeas corpus.
4,0,0,I understand you're cold natured, but . . .
3,1,0,Now they will read each of the 107,343,279,045 counts.
3,1,0,Our client should be here shortly.
2,1,1,Under the best case scenario, you’ll get the death penalty.
3,1,0,No, a hung jury does not mean they all die.
2,1,1,Yes, yes, pro bono!
3,0,1,Tomorrow, wear a suit.
4,0,0,The first thing they will try to do is find a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,I think I can get them down to afterlife without parole.
3,1,0,Was it really you?
2,2,0,Worst case? You get life.
4,0,0,They ruled a mistrial on the death penalty case a little late.
4,0,0,I think I have a conflict of interest.
4,0,0,This judge has sentenced more people to death than...you.
3,1,0,If asked about your time on Wall Street, remember what I said; you were "fruitfully remunerated."
4,0,0,Let me frank. You're on trial for you life here.
2,1,1,Do we appeal the death sentence?
4,0,0,Remember! You were just following orders!
2,1,1,Look, if you really want to help, jurors 3, 7 and 12 could do with an "early release".
2,1,0,Their best offer is anger management 7 times a week.
3,1,0,So, what brings you here?
4,0,0,Don't give me that blank stare. You can't have a balloon.
4,0,0,My plan is to use the empty hoodie defense
3,1,0,You being the Grim Reaper is not a defense in this case!
0,1,3,Yes, I'm all for the death penalty, but this is traffic court.
2,0,0,Pssst... lose the robe.
4,0,0,I know you, your the return of a ghost hoped past
3,1,0,I recommend jury tampering.
3,1,0,As your attorney, I need to know where your head is at.
3,1,0,Okay, you can keep the hood, but please wear glasses tomorrow. We need the jury to see your softer side.
2,0,0,I also represent the IRS
1,1,0,It's tricky--you might get the death penalty.
3,1,0,You're lucky we're in California.
4,0,0,If you owe more than $10,000 in Back Death Taxes, call us today. We're former 'IRS' workers that will work directly with the 'IRS' on your behalf. Don't take on the 'IRS' alone. Give us a call. Operators are standing by.
4,0,0,I'm saving you talents for the penalty phase.
4,0,0,Are you sure a quote from Thanatopsis is an appropriate response?
4,0,0,Probably better not to mention your boss by name or even location.
3,0,0,The vows clearly said you can just leave.
4,0,0,Wouldn't it be ironic if you got life?
3,1,0,They don't understand that you would welcome the death penalty.
3,1,0,The last thing you need to worry about is a death sentence.
4,0,0,You are charged with first degree grimness.
4,0,0,You're telling me this now?
3,1,0,You may very well have faced He Who Judges All Mankind, but in the courtroom of the 63rd District magistrate, I'm the one who knows how to play the game.
3,1,0,Oh, uh-that's not what I meant by a hung jury.
4,0,0,It's the season's finale!"
4,0,0,It might make you feel better if you just play along.
3,1,0,Seriously, let me do the talking. No one has ever beaten Death.
3,0,1,Well, at least we don't have to worry about capital punishment.
2,1,0,Sorry, superior orders is not a good defense.
4,0,0,next time leave a witness
3,1,0,You may have dressed for the occasion.
4,0,0,As your defense attorney, I'd recommend establishing eye contact with the jurors.
2,2,0,I think it's better if you don't testify.
2,2,0,Inevitability is not a defense.
4,0,0,He already said claiming to be the God of Death is not a defense in a court of law.
4,0,0,To be honest, I've never handled a death penalty case before.
1,2,1,Really? You? Pro-life?
1,2,1,I think our best hope at this point is a hung jury.
4,0,0,You'll get off no problem- I was on O.J.'s defense team.
0,3,1,They said you'll be given a fate worse than you
2,1,1,We're hoping for a hung jury.
2,0,0,- I took the scythe cause it might adversely affect the jury! - But they can't convict me when it's my job!
2,1,0,That's fine, but then you'll need to do the taxes phase of the trial.
3,1,0,Nobody innocent wears a hoodie
2,1,0,What did you expect, wearing a black hoodie in that neighborhood?
3,1,0,Remember, you're just a harbinger of death - not the root cause.
2,1,1,You're sure nobody saw your face?
3,1,0,Should I have worn the blue one?
3,1,0,I'm afraid they want to give you Life.
3,1,0,Well, yes the outfit is a problem.......
3,0,0,It's in the bag - this state doesn't have a death penalty.
4,0,0,If you're asked, just say that you met Dante in college.
2,0,2,I don't think we have to worry about a death sentence.
4,0,0,How long have you been in mort-gage law?
4,0,0,You can't go along passing yourself off as Mark Zuckerberg without repercussions.
2,1,1,So, you're hoping for the death penalty?
4,0,0,I don't think they'll take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,Yes, senatorial confirmation is scary but I still think you should give them your name.
4,0,0,No Mr. Reaper ,with your record a deadlocked jury is highly unlikely .
3,0,1,Now that denial and anger are out of the way, they should be ready to bargain.
4,0,0,I see you are dressed for a s;am dunk!
4,0,0,Don;t worry, the bailiff forgot to bring a bible
3,1,0,If nobody turns up the scythe, you could walk.
2,1,0,If you cop a plea, I can probably talk the prosecutor down to the death penalty.
4,0,0,Listen, can you get me out of this profession?
2,2,0,I was hoping for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Chances look grim, Reaper.
3,1,0,Judge Zachary is offering leniency if you could maybe alphabetize the list.
4,0,0,The only way I can get the jury to overlook the fact that you've killed everyone in the history of the world is if you get rid of the hoodie.
2,1,1,I know you have to be at st. Barnabas Hospital in 15 minutes but this is important.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, the judge refused to accept your plea of death
3,1,0,Short of a living will, their argument is immaterial.
4,0,0,You reap what you reap.
3,1,0,So I told him, 'Not til Hell Freezes Over!'
3,1,0,Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting in touch with your alibi.
3,0,1,Legally, our insanity defense makes sense. Existentially, we're opening up a can of worms.
4,0,0,I will check their I.D. next time.
3,1,0,Life without parole is the best you can expect.
4,0,0,You got to face up to it...
3,1,0,Any priors?
2,0,2,No, the death penalty is a bad thing.
4,0,0,You can't get the death penalty if you're already dead.
4,0,0,The judge and jury may not look too kindly at your professional success.
1,1,2,Ironically, you could get Life....
0,1,1,Since you're already dead, they'll give you life.
1,2,1,There's no law against cheating death, unfortunately.
2,1,0,Again, you have no priors, right?
3,0,0,I don't care if you just came from the WPT, this is a court of law and you should dress appropriately.
3,1,0,This case is the least of my problems?
3,1,0,Sorry, but I really need Christmas Past on this case.
4,0,0,Face facts, man, if you show your face, you'll be faced with a felony.
4,0,0,You want life? Listen, I'm a good defense attorney, but not that good!
4,0,0,You do realize you look sketchy as heck?
4,0,0,You cannot expect to escape The Chair by using the Unabomber Defense!
3,1,0,What did I tell you about white juries and hoodies?!!?
2,2,0,Your appearance isn't helping.
4,0,0,My client invokes his right to habeas corpses.
3,1,0,Sorry, the death penalty doesn't apply here.
3,1,0,You're going to loose the jury with the hood and Grim Reaper crap.
4,0,0,Don't get discouraged. They're just not used to seeing a hoodie in court.
3,1,0,Let's not kid ourselves, the IRS is a tough opponent.
3,1,0,No worries. I'll argue that you were profiled.
3,1,0,Sir, this is a tax case--I am certain we can win on appeal.
4,0,0,Best case scenario: we get life....
2,1,0,I defended Taxes and let's just say you should take the deal.
3,1,0,The bad news is death is off the table.
4,0,0,Sorry you have to go empty-handed. My client took the life sentence deal.
3,0,1,The worst they can give you is life, so you'll be out in no time at all.
3,1,0,Would I have gotten a better lawyer if I had paid more?
4,0,0,You've been sentenced to death. Then again, that's probably your call when it actually happens.
4,0,0,Do you REALLY think ANYBODY can identify ME?
3,0,0,The death penalty. You have to appreciate the meta.
3,1,0,Are you absolutely certain you don't have any more skeletons in your closet?
4,0,0,All I'm saying is that the hoodie looks menacing, Karl. Would it have killed you to put on a suit like I asked?
2,0,2,Sorry, it looks like they're not going to exclude your priors.
4,0,0,It doesn't matter that his name was on your list.
2,1,1,Yeah, I think it's a possibility that they may consider the death penalty.
3,1,0,No juror's gonna find you guilty!
4,0,0,Tell me your darkest secret!
3,0,1,I can get you life.
3,0,0,If it's a life sentence, we'll appeal.
3,1,0,The public has a bad perception of us lawyers
4,0,0,This is a murder case. You need to show more emotion.
4,0,0,I'm pleading occupational hazard.
1,3,0,I'm sorry, but "I was just doing my job" is not a valid defense.
4,0,0,On the bright side, the jury can't give you the death penalty again
3,1,0,I'm not sure you have the stomach for this.
4,0,0,They're checking for precedent on Habeas Spiritus.
2,2,0,Sorry. No body, no habeus corpus.
3,1,0,Gee Rob, I'm glad it's not your sense of humor that's on trial here.
4,0,0,The "gloom and doom" defense won't fly.
4,0,0,You could plead ignorance, but it is the other certainty in life.
4,0,0,He said, 'Will the accused please face the court.'"
4,0,0,At least they won't give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,If you want any sympathy from the jury, ditch the hood.
2,1,1,Even you can't dodge taxes.
3,1,0,Be sure to peer earnestly at the jury.
2,2,0,Would you be willing to do community service?
4,0,0,If I put you on the stand they'll see right through you.
3,1,0,When the Prosecution asks you to take the stand, do that evil laugh thing.
4,0,0,ECHO ... Echo ... echo ...
2,1,1,Its true people can't cheat you, but corporations can.
3,0,0,Do you want to plead as a corporation or a person?
2,1,1,You are against the death penalty?
4,0,0,May the police force be with you
3,1,0,I already have a death sentence.
4,0,0,"Death penalty"...get it?
4,0,0,Okay, the visit was just a social call and the heart attack was entirely coincidental
4,0,0,But you only spent one night in Rikeres
1,2,1,I'm not sure that telling the judge to "go to hell" is exactly our best defense.
3,1,0,Remember: the death was consensual.
3,1,0,Take it! You'll be out in a 100 years with good behavior.
3,0,1,I don't think smiling at the jury is helping our case
1,1,2,A hung jury, Mr. Reaper, is not what is not what you think it is.
3,1,0,Stop telling the Judge to refer to it as "The Me Penalty"
4,0,0,I wouldn't worry about the sentencing phase. You're already a dead man.
1,2,0,Your prospects look grim.
2,1,0,I'm having a hard time putting a face on your case.
1,3,0,Requesting the death penalty would seem self-serving.
4,0,0,It is going to be easier if you confess.
3,0,0,You're lucky, the capital punishment is not permitted in this state...
2,2,0,No, this would NOT be an appropriate time to tell the judge his sentence.
4,0,0,Pleading guilty will avoid you death penalty.
1,2,1,They're enhancing the charge to aggravated reap.
1,1,2,Only YOU could think the death penalty is a slap on the wrist.
4,0,0,We'll stipulate your scythe is a deadly weapon.
3,1,0,Unfortunately, they abolished the death penalty.
4,0,0,Wouldl you be interested in hearing about a new term life policy?
4,0,0,Maybe the police planted the scythe.
2,0,1,Just doing your job, right?
2,0,1,Yeah, keep staring real hard at the jury members.
4,0,0,How about this? I get you off and you let me live until Apple's no more.
4,0,0,So we'll ask for clemency. They've got you dead to rights on that shell game business.
4,0,0,Well what do you think about if the scythe don't fit you must acquit?
3,1,0,Are you sure you want to claim you had affluenza?
4,0,0,OK. So you'll take the Fifth.
2,2,0,This is a civil case. We can only ask for monetary damages.
3,0,0,"What do you mean you don't think juror number 11 will make it to the end of the trial"?
4,0,0,No need to hide your face
3,0,1,Now try to not look so grim.
2,1,0,Voir Dire is going to take a while...Most people know, and have strong preconceived opinions, about you.
4,0,0,Remind them you're a contributing civil servant as a Texas Executioner.
2,1,0,He wants a stay of execution.
3,0,0,So, how go things in The Hood?
3,1,0,I think we have a better chance if we go with your middle name - Larry Reaper'
2,2,0,your hoodie will just prejudice the jury
3,1,0,No worries, our strategy is to save face.
2,1,1,Guess a death sentence hits close to home, eh?
3,1,0,This lawsuit against you is the biggest class action I have ever seen.
1,1,1,Not to be morbid, but you could be sentenced to life.
2,2,0,The jury is watching you every moment. Try not to look so grim...
3,1,0,Let's put you on the stand and hope for a hung jury.
3,1,0,Your character witnesses just aren't panning out.
4,0,0,This case is gonna be the death of me...
2,2,0,You can't wear the same clothes you were seen wearing in the CCTV.
3,0,0,The hoodie scares people.
2,2,0,No, we could not find one juror who had not experienced your work in their own lives.
3,0,1,Shouting "death to all mortals" really isn't helping your case, Larry.
3,0,0,No, you cannot sue Ingmar Bergmann for violation of your right of publicity.
4,0,0,From the Grim Reaper "So... Do I get my Sythe back?"
4,0,0,"I'm the only judge around here," said Death to his lawyer.
1,1,1,I'm pretty sure we can wrangle joint custody of the kids, but she's probably going to get the pale horse.
1,2,0,When you testify, try to convey your repentance.
3,0,0,I hope you have a lot of cash stuffed up that robe.
1,1,2,This may be a rough go. The judge is pro-life.
4,0,0,Thanks for agreeing to leave the scythe outside the courtroom.
2,2,0,Well, at least we don't have to worry about fingerprints.
3,1,0,I realize "he had it comin", but let's stick with self-defense.
3,1,0,It's never been tried before, but we're going with a raison d'etre defense.
3,0,0,Okay. Once more: You woke up on January 1st, broke, out of a job and the scythe was just lying there.
1,1,0,You have to give them Taxes, it's our only chance.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, it's a capital offence.
4,0,0,Funny? I find nothing funny about the Judge wearing a robe.
3,0,0,Now remember, it's because you were wearing a hoodie.
3,1,0,When the judge says something you disagree with, try to not point at him ominously.
2,0,2,I think your best shot is the Ingmar Bergman defense.
3,0,1,You said we'll fight it to the death, but I didn't realize who I'd be representing.
3,0,1,Didn't I ask you to wear a softer color?
4,0,0,I think your only defense is to take the stand and sing You Can Call Me Al.
3,1,0,Don't be so gloomy, you'll scare the jury
2,1,0,We've got them on occupational profiling.
3,1,0,I think the bribery charge is the least of our worries.
2,0,1,Not sure I like our chances, you literally hung the jury.
2,1,0,We couldn't Find any peers for the jury
4,0,0,There is a hollow ring to what you say.
3,1,0,Your chances for acquittal look grim.
3,0,1,I need you to look alive when you take the stand.
2,1,1,Sometimes, it is like looking in a mirror
4,0,0,Why didn't you wear your Justin Bieber mask like I told you to?
4,0,0,Be not proud.
4,0,0,Your CPA is dead? Now you tell me?
2,2,0,I think we can cut a deal if you let some of them live
2,2,0,You're not the type to hold a grudge are you?
4,0,0,When you take the stand, try to be up-beat.
3,1,0,The good news is the prosecutor is taking the You Penalty off the table.
2,1,0,So our defense is that if the scythe was a lethal weapon, it was therefore a tool of your trade
4,0,0,Forget it. There's no way you're getting life.
3,1,0,I'll get the case dismissed for your inability to face your accuser.
3,1,0,Yes, I'm certain. I handle taxes, and you handle…you know, …what you handle.
3,1,0,I assume avoiding the death penalty isn't a priority.
1,3,0,May I call you Grim, Mr. Reaper?
3,0,0,Listen...you've GOT to give me your real name!
1,2,1,What do you mean, you WANT life?
4,0,0,I know y ou've handled more death penalty caes than anyone.
3,0,1,If we're lucky...they"ll offer a death sentence
4,0,0,The jury ruled in favor of taxes--you, they're not so sure about.
3,0,0,They're going to try to pin you on motive, but just play it cool. The prosecution has nothing on you.
4,0,0,Look innocent; nobody suspects that you killed him.
3,0,1,Yes, I understand that a life sentence is not your first choice.
3,0,0,I don't think you can invoke the 5th Parallel.
3,0,0,This case is going to kill me
3,1,0,I think a saffron robe would look friendlier.
3,0,1,Honestly, your outfit is a little much. I suppose I should just be glad you didn't wear your #NoLivesMatter t-shirt to court.
2,1,1,He's going to ask for whom the bell tolls. Whatever you do, don't answer!
3,0,0,The judge is ok. With luck, I think I can get you off with death.
4,0,0,Did you do it?
1,1,2,They're offering life.
3,1,0,Can you swear that the death was accidental?
2,0,2,There seems to be a little problem with finding a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,So you save face, and maybe find yourself ahead in the end. Win-win.
2,0,1,As your council I think its best not bring up Obi-Wan Kenobi
4,0,0,This case is a killer.
3,1,0,If you plead guilty, you will get life.
3,1,0,Oddly enough, I'll be paying a visit to Juror No. 5 this evening.
3,1,0,You want the death penalty? This is tax court.
4,0,0,Your chances would be better in a suit and tie.
3,0,0,Before I start I have one last question. What happens to me if I lose?
2,2,0,When the bailiff says "all rise", don't get cute.
2,0,2,They can't invoke the death penalty, that would be double indemnity.
2,2,0,Remember, you were at home watching “What Not to Wear.”
4,0,0,Darn! That hoodie's going to influence the jury in a negative way.
2,0,2,Now don't forget to shake hands with the prosecutor.
3,1,0,If the prosecutor asks you to state your name, just plead the Fifth.
3,0,1,The DA says he won't plea bargain with death.
2,1,1,If the sickle is too little, we’ll get an acquittal.
3,0,1,Yes, your best chance at this point would be a hung jury.
4,0,0,that's not how the death penalty works
4,0,0,you cant win for losin'
4,0,0,Do you vape?
4,0,0,"The judge isn't going to allow the hoodie".
4,0,0,No. You do not want to take the stand.
3,1,0,I'm not going to lie to you, things look grim.
4,0,0,They found your fingerprints on the queen's bishop.
4,0,0,'It's time we take about my bill...'
4,0,0,Let's face it, you look like a hoodlum.
4,0,0,You can't object every time I say 'habeas corpus.'
3,1,0,On a good day and a hung jury, you might get 32 consecutive life sentences.
4,0,0,If we lose this case, you're dead to me.
3,0,0,Sir, if you insist on wearing that hoodie, they're definitely going to think you killed all those people.
4,0,0,Did you really wait 9 months for your hoodie?
3,0,1,You look very grim.
4,0,0,It's completely circumstantial; it could have been anyone's scythe.
2,2,0,You probably could've gotten away with it if you didn't post those photos on Instagram.
3,1,0,It doesn't look good, Sir.
4,0,0,I'll have you out of here by lunch Mr.Trump.
3,1,0,You're right. It didn't kill me to object
3,1,0,"They've taken the death penalty off the table".
2,0,2,OK. I'll ask for the death sentence.
4,0,0,Once again, that you only hired the hit man is not a viable defense.
3,1,0,What are the odds? I specialize in estate taxes.
3,1,0,The facts aren't great but motive may be hard to prove
2,1,0,So what's our plan if the judge doesn't offer me the death penalty?
3,0,0,American Crime Story: The People vs The GOP
3,0,0,No witness. No DNA. No case!
2,1,1,I'm pretty sure that would be contempt of court.
3,1,0,I've never seen anything like it -- seven billion restraining orders.
4,0,0,I'm sorry to tell you sir, but I'm going to rush this a little, you see, later on I have an Appointment in Sumarra.
2,1,1,Don't look so grim. I'm sure I can get you off with just the death penalty.
3,0,1,They are requesting you wear a glove.
1,2,0,Ironically, this isn't a death-penalty state, so you don't have to worry about that.
3,0,0,"Their time was up" isn't a defence Mr Reaper.
3,1,0,Start with the death and taxes joke to soften up the jury.
3,1,0,What do you care? It's only 25 years.
2,1,0,Good thing is you're not charged with murder
4,0,0,For the trial I said formal dress not normal!
3,1,0,I keep telling you . . . the prosecution has six nuns who saw you.
4,0,0,Looks like you're going to get Death Row!
4,0,0,Frankly, it looks grim.
4,0,0,I told you not to show your face around here!
3,0,1,I’m not sure that having you challenge the prosecutor to a chess match is a good idea.
3,1,0,Just sit there and look innocent.
3,1,0,You know, we don't have a ghost of a chance, don't you?
4,0,0,How are you not in jail yet?
3,0,1,I'm glad you brought your game face.
4,0,0,You're my ace in the hole.
4,0,0,Your not here because of that stuff. You're here because you didn't pay your taxes.
3,1,0,I told you.....no eye contact with the jury!
2,2,0,If we plea bargain now I can get you life.
4,0,0,Tell them you were just following orders.
4,0,0,Yes, I know you're usually the penalty, but you've angered the wrong people this time.
4,0,0,You better prepare yourself for the death penalty.
2,2,0,And don't forget, whatever you do don't look the jury in the eye.
3,1,0,Let's face You are a born loser.
3,1,0,Let me do the talking, and remember, you have never been to Panama.
4,0,0,Lose the hoody and smile a little.
4,0,0,I asked the judge for community service.
4,0,0,I think I can have the charges dismissed on mistaken identity.
3,0,1,I say its worth the risk. If the Scythe is too short, they can't possibly convict you.
3,1,0,I don't think a change of venue would do you much good.
1,3,0,I don't think I can get you life.
4,0,0,We won't settle. They can't leverage the death penalty.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I'd sat our chances are GRIM!
3,1,0,We can beat those murder chargers, it's the parking ticket...
3,1,0,You realize seeking the death penalty for jaywalking is irregular.
1,2,1,Your arguments in opposition to physician-assisted suicide appear self-serving.
4,0,0,Of course I believe you
4,0,0,You should have worn a suit. The jury is unfairly prejudiced against dark defendents wearing hoodies.
4,0,0,"We need to produce a witness who was with you that day".
3,1,0,There's quite a few old people on the jury.
3,0,0,Like I said, nothing is dead certain.
1,2,0,Contrary to your objections, I still intend to argue for life.
4,0,0,If the Scythe doesn't fit they have to acquit...
4,0,0,You won't have to plead the 5th or anything else. Leave that to everyone else in the room.
3,0,0,It seems all witnesses for the prosecution have recently suffered fatal accidents.
3,1,0,At least she won't be able to identify you.
3,0,1,Let me live and this hour is half price.
4,0,0,I know it's tempting, but please avoid using the death and taxes cliche.
4,0,0,The good news is they've agreed to have your 11 billion life sentences run concurrently.
3,0,1,No, Mr. Reaper by saying "Corpus Delicti" the hot prosecutor was not flirting!
1,3,0,You know, the blue cloak makes you seem honest.
2,1,1,How is it not a penalty?
3,0,0,So, we're going for the death penalty, not eternal life on parole?
4,0,0,You never know who the true person you are defending is.
4,0,0,Technically the Death penalty might just mean probation in your case.
4,0,0,And for Pete's sake, don't make eye contact with anyone on the jury.
3,1,0,It's judgment day
2,0,1,You might've expected the metal detector to pick up the scythe.
3,1,0,How's life?, Is life good for you?
3,0,0,Scythe doesn't matter.
3,1,0,I realize that you've been doing it for millennia, I just don't think that's a viable defense...
3,1,0,The person that you visited died? That was your alibi!
1,2,1,The good news is all one hundred and two billion sentences are to run concurrently
3,1,0,Last week I was the Devil's advocate.
4,0,0,Try being a little cagey about this. You don't want them to know you WANT the death penalty.
3,1,0,We're still having trouble getting a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,I believe you've met judge and jury.
3,1,0,I asked you to dress solemnly, not gravely.
4,0,0,As co-counsel, you should wear a tie.
2,2,0,We're getting killed.
3,1,0,The judge will review our motion on the grounds that it was an authorized holiday.
4,0,0,So as you can see, your Honor, my client, who shall remain faceless, could not have been at the scene of the crime.
3,1,0,'I think the judge giving you the death penalty is a little on the redundant side."
4,0,0,You reaper what you sower
3,1,0,Would you prefer a life sentence or a death sentence?
3,1,0,I understand that you're the Grim Reaper, but the judge thinks he's God.
3,1,0,You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
3,1,0,I know that is the name you prefer and have always gone by but I feel it prejudices the jury.
2,2,0,Soooo, no matter which way the jury goes, we're OK. Right?
4,0,0,I'm afraid the witness just described the assailant as having hollow cheeks.
3,0,1,How about never. Is never good for you?
4,0,0,As your attorney, I need to remind you that if you are found guilty, you can get the 'you' penalty.
2,0,2,They would like to know where you were between 1665 and 1666.
4,0,0,Under no circumstances are you to breath on me.
4,0,0,We'll try and downplay your employment history, OK?
4,0,0,I'ts Your Honor not you're next !
2,1,1,The judge says for you to habeas corpus and be quick about it.
4,0,0,Trust me, the facts speak for themselve.
3,1,0,No, you can't try on the scythe. It's not a glove.
3,1,0,I asked you to wear a nice suit.
3,0,0,Congratulations, they've denied his writ of Habeas Corpus.
4,0,0,Look, I've been doing this for a long time, and I don't think dressing up in a coat and tie is going to help you with the jury.
3,1,0,Couldn't you have worn something else?
2,1,1,Let's make sure we get you a suit for the next court date.
3,1,0,We got a writ of habeas corpses.
3,1,0,I'm afraid the jury is deadlocked.
4,0,0,They're going to try to establish intent.
3,1,0,The jurors don't like your body language.
2,0,1,You know, it's not like pleading guilty is going to kill you
3,1,0,They've offered a plea of Manslaughter.
4,0,0,You have the right to remain passive.
3,0,0,In my estimation, it's unlikely you'll get life.
3,0,1,Remember, if the hood don't fit.....you must acquit......!
3,1,0,I'm not sure "Everyone makes a mistake once in a while" is going to fly
4,0,0,Remember, we plead the fifth if they ask about age-related bias in your selection process.
3,1,0,It's too bad capital punishment isn't legal here cause, y'know, you'll end up just going back to where you came from... Because you're death.
3,1,0,The judge doesn't like hoodies.
3,1,0,I'm pretty sure I can get you life.
1,2,0,This time, don't hang the jury until after they announce the verdict.
3,0,0,What do you mean, have I ever been an attorney for an eternal client before?
1,3,0,In a word: No more high fives.
3,1,0,Not sure they'll think the death penalty plea will make it even.
4,0,0,So I see you pay your taxes in flesh.
3,1,0,Pro bono? With your record, it means you're screwed.
4,0,0,Life without parole in your case is worse than death as I calculate it.
4,0,0,The good news is they've ruled out the death penalty.
3,1,0,Yes, I can ask the judge what is meant by "life in prison".
4,0,0,I'm pretty sure I'm immune to the death penalty.
4,0,0,Famine has turned state's evidence.
3,0,0,Did you kill this man?
3,0,1,I'm sorry, you're just not eligible for death row.
4,0,0,You got lucky it's a hung jury, they actually hung themselves."
4,0,0,No,. They're saying it's the other way around.
4,0,0,I hear Panama is nice this time of year.
4,0,0,So, you actually weren't wearing a hoodie that night?
4,0,0,I'll ask for it to be commuted to life.
4,0,0,If this verdict doesn't turn out well, mind if I take over?
3,1,0,Spoiler alert! We don't have the death penalty in this state.
2,1,1,Okay, if it comes down as a Life Sentence, I'll file a quick appeal and see if I can get you Death.
4,0,0,You didn't tell me there were multiple counts.
4,0,0,Don't worry. I'm going with the 'if the sickle don't fit, you must acquit' defense.
4,0,0,'This might be tricky, they have you at the scene'
4,0,0,No chance in hell you'll win on wrongful death.
3,1,0,I guess a death sentence is redundant.
2,2,0,I think we can pretty much rule out the death penalty.
4,0,0,Just plead the fifth-it'll strengthen your case.
3,1,0,Because without the plea bargain you'll get life.
4,0,0,If things go well for you I think we can get the judge to settle for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Taxes got life but you'll probably get time served.
4,0,0,"Okay, now remember - our strategy is the inevitability of taxes." 'taxes' is in italics.
4,0,0,Don't you worry. This free healthcare bill won't ever leave this room!
4,0,0,I'm afraid the best we can hope for is a hung jury.
3,1,0,I'm not sure 'the death penalty arouses my loins' won you much jury support.
3,0,0,It's a reverse plea bargain. They want you 50 years to life.
4,0,0,Now turn and face the jury.
2,2,0,The prosecution has agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,Okay, so my first question is "Why don't you tell no tales?"
4,0,0,Quite frankly, I think your getting off light with the death penalty...
2,1,1,Don't worry - the death penalty is still on the table.
4,0,0,Seriously? Even the judge's childhood pet gerbil?
4,0,0,You have a great prima facie case for your identity theft.
4,0,0,I am too busy to die move on
3,0,1,Did you even bother to look in the mirror this morning?
4,0,0,I think we can do better than the death penalty for a traffic violation.
3,1,0,I know a way out of this, but I'm not sure you're going to like it.
2,2,0,Well, who else can we pin it on?
3,1,0,This is not what I had in mind when I told you to dress for a somber occasion.
3,0,1,I'm not suggesting anything, but juror #7 has a heart condition.
3,1,0,Good news. The death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,Remember, no matter what: don't let them see you sweat
3,1,0,All I'm saying is it could help your case to lose the hoodie and remember to put your face on before showing up every morning.
3,1,0,You know, a suit and tie would have made a better impression.
4,0,0,You'd think the right to remain silent wouldn't have been so hard for you.
4,0,0,Just answer the question honestly. Have you ever owned a sickle?
2,1,0,If you plead innocent, you might get the death penalty.
4,0,0,Do not show any emotion.
1,1,1,For now, we'll leave getting the hung jury to me.
4,0,0,Is my Facebook profile picture going to be a problem?
3,1,0,No...."Death Penalty" isn't an insult.
3,1,0,I'm afraid it looks grim...
4,0,0,Remember, she was already dead when you arrived.
3,1,0,Don't worry if we lose. They keep calling it a penalty but it'll feel more like a slap on the wrist.
1,0,2,I think we should enter a plea of inevitable.
4,0,0,I will not let you speak in your own defense, Mr Reaper.
4,0,0,Am I representing you? Or, are you representing me?
3,1,0,This is no time to try and save face.
3,0,0,I told you to wear your blue suit. You know this state does not have the death penalty.
4,0,0,Just plead the 5th. It works for everyone else.
4,0,0,No, "death sentence" does not mean you have to make a closing argument.
3,0,0,You're an at-will employee, so unfortunately there isn't much more I can do for you.
2,0,2,I wouldn't worry about getting the death penalty.
2,1,1,Character witnesses are going to be a problem.
3,0,0,Which members of the jury panel will you preemptorily strike?
2,2,0,so tell me about your depression
4,0,0,Too bad you can't sit in the back.
4,0,0,Your chances? Slim to none.
2,1,0,Fortunately, this state doesn't carry the death penalty. At most you'll get life.
4,0,0,To pick a jury of your peers, we need bottom feeders: foreclosure buyers, eviction specialists and conservative think tank linguistics artists who praise the need "tax relief."
3,1,0,Sorry, no habeas corpus without a corpus.
3,1,0,When you’re called to the stand, don’t shake anyone’s hand.
3,0,0,...but they've got nobody to carry out the death penalty.
4,0,0,You may be the Grimm Reaper, but it's still Murder 1.
3,1,0,Let's just agree that the death penalty is a moot point
4,0,0,Arguing against the death penalty does seem counterintuitive.
4,0,0,I'll testify I've never stepped foot in Sleepy Hollow. I can't speak for the horse.
4,0,0,Let's call it a scythe.
3,1,0,Couldn't you at least try to look contrite and remorseful?
3,1,0,A hoodie! Couldn't you wear something else?
3,1,0,Prepare yourself. They have no choice but to seek the death penalty.
4,0,0,You can always take the 5th.
4,0,0,The judge is insisting that to dismiss "prima facie" you actually have to have a face.
3,1,0,On the plus side, capital punishment in this state is "beheading".
2,1,0,On the bright side, they've reduced the taxes...
3,1,0,Don't forget to smile.
4,0,0,I've told you repeatedly, the death penalty is not a plea deal.
4,0,0,If we play our cards right, I can get you life.
3,1,0,In your case, you could get life.
2,2,0,The district attorney is going to ask for life. He says the death penalty is too good for you.
4,0,0,I'd lose the hood if I were you.
4,0,0,No, that won't fly; it really was worse than taxes.
4,0,0,Hi, Harry Potter esq. I'm either going to defend you, or pull out my wand and yell "Expecto Patronum"
3,1,0,"Without a face they don't have a case".
2,1,0,You're on trial for plagiarism—and stop stealing your case files.
4,0,0,Saying you were just doing your job won’t work.
4,0,0,I can't make any promises .. your rap sheet is the longest I've ever seen ... and jurors are turned off by the hoody.
3,1,0,In the eyes of the jury, removing your hoodie might make you seem a little more human.
2,0,1,Problem with all your alibi witnesses...
1,2,0,And if I lose my case?
1,0,2,Stop laughing whenever they mention the death penalty.
2,1,1,They can't find the bodies you buried, but they've got you on tax evasion.
3,1,0,Just face the jury with that blank look on your face.
2,1,1,I guess no matter what, it's a Death sentence.
3,0,1,We know you did it, but when is it going to stop?
3,0,0,The jury thinks you are a hoodlum.
4,0,0,Good news - we've got it down to 5,456,894,553 consequetive life sentences...
4,0,0,You realize you're getting life?
2,0,2,Why do I always have to be "taxes"?
3,0,0,"Hipster grass cutting?" Really?
3,1,0,Relax. No jury would dare find you guilty.
4,0,0,Believe me, I'm trying to get you the death penalty.
4,0,0,I keep telling you, "It's what I do," is not a viable defense.
4,0,0,As your counsel, I strongly advise you to ditch the hoodie.
1,0,2,We're having some trouble finding impartial jurors.
2,2,0,I'll move for a mistrial. If the judge says no, you kill everyone but me.
3,1,0,I warned you not to wear a hoodie! Now you're goose is cooked!
4,0,0,"W'll plead justifiable homicide.":
3,1,0,I completely agree. There's no way they'll recognize you without the scythe.
4,0,0,Shh, shut up and hide your reaper.
1,2,1,Eliminating jurors - your way - won't help our case.
4,0,0,No pun intended, but you have to face the facts
2,2,0,The reaper is admissible, but I'm objecting to calling it grim.
4,0,0,This trial will be the death of me.
2,1,0,I think you should pick the jury.
4,0,0,Good news - They've agreed not to seek the death penalty
3,1,0,Your new sickle holster is amazing. I couldn't even tell you are carrying.
4,0,0,Just stick with that you can't put a face with a name.
2,2,0,What are you in the dark about? They said you used deadly force!
4,0,0,I realize she wouldn't stop for you, but that doesn't mean that if you kindly stop for her you aren't violating a traffic law.
4,0,0,I know that you have your rights, but let me do the talking.
4,0,0,Remember, I'm doing this pro bono.
2,1,0,The Judge said you CAN sue all those guys who claimed they cheated you.
4,0,0,Frankly, I'd rather be defending you than taxes.
4,0,0,Here's the deal: You give them naming rights, they let you walk.
4,0,0,Tell 'em you've been advised that it's your duty to not answer any frikkin' questions.
4,0,0,Don't worry--there's no life penalty in this state.
4,0,0,The judge has to sentence you to death or life in prison. Either way, you're OK.
3,0,0,My daughter would be scared.
3,0,0,I think we'll go with the black hole defense.
4,0,0,You tell all your clients to plead "no contest," don't you?
4,0,0,Ironically, they are seeking the death penalty Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Let's put you on the stand in your defense.
4,0,0,If the jury stares directly in your face, I'd say we're cooked.
3,1,0,I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate here.
3,1,0,I think I can get you life without parole.
4,0,0,I'm glad to see you decided to take my advice and face the charges like the man you seem to be.
4,0,0,You're lucky there's no death peanalty.
2,1,0,So... Who handles it if you get the death penalty?
4,0,0,I think the hoodie is overkill!
2,2,0,On a side note, keep sending those ambulances, and I'll keep chasing'em.
4,0,0,Are you here just for the taxes?
4,0,0,I think putting you on the witness stand could be a big mistake.
4,0,0,This being a capital case, there may be a conflict of interest here.
3,1,0,I don't think the jury is buying the argument that you are a tax-exempt nonprofit.
3,1,0,If the cloak don't fit, they must acquit.
3,1,0,As your lawyer I must advise you not to kill anyone during the lunch break.
3,1,0,I don't think you need to worry about the death penalty.
3,1,0,Don't worry. We're going to win this. It's all in the jury selection.
3,1,0,Striking jurors is my job, not yours
3,1,0,Who'd have thought they'd get you for tax evasion.
2,2,0,I'm hopeful.
3,1,0,We're sticking with mistaken identity.
3,1,0,Groan once for yes, twice for no.
3,1,0,Normally I'd suggest you remove your hood but I think we'll make an exception today...
3,1,0,Just like all the other times, be yourself - quiet and grim - and let me do the talking.
4,0,0,death becomes you but let's not rush it.
2,1,1,The deal is, if I get you off, I never see you again.
4,0,0,I think I can get an acquittal if we can come up with a rhyme for "scythe."
3,1,0,None of your alibi witnesses seem to be available
3,1,0,I told the judge you'd be willing to extend his life sentence if he gets rid of yours.
4,0,0,...the good news is that I hear orange is the new black.
4,0,0,I think it's a bit too much for a parking ticket.
4,0,0,Can we prove the reaping was an accident?
3,0,0,Just remember: deny, deny deny.
2,2,0,It's "So help me God." You don't have to mean it.
3,1,0,Are you certain?
3,1,0,You're not doomed.
3,1,0,Try to look less grim.
3,0,1,Mr. Reaper, I'm afraid that "It was his time to go" is not a legal defense.
4,0,0,Your best option is to take the death penalty.
2,1,1,No, you cannot dig up any witnesses.
4,0,0,It guaranteed the removal of all lines, scars and sun damage.
4,0,0,Keep your mouth shut and let me do all the talking.
3,0,0,Let's forget about making eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,I doubt you'll get a life sentence.
1,1,2,No! Just saying"It was their time" won't work.
3,1,0,It's the Supreme Court. I don't think they recognize any higher authority.
2,2,0,Our chances are looking grim.
3,1,0,Well, then maybe we should skip the character witnesses
1,2,0,Worst case scenario, you'll be sentenced to life.
2,2,0,Bad news. The police found the scythe.
3,1,0,Just plead not guilty, and try to look innocent
3,1,0,I'm afraid we can't get you on death row.
2,0,2,On the bright side, the penalty is named in your honor.
4,0,0,You can't REQUEST a death sentence!
3,1,0,Your scythe set off the metal detectors, huh?
4,0,0,Your problem is you're a one-trick pony.
3,1,0,You call that your smile?
4,0,0,Please rise court is in session "Shouldn't you have objected to that?" Said Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Yes, Texas does have the death penalty.
3,1,0,Habeas what?
4,0,0,No, you're not permitted to take the Fifth when the issue is crimes against nature.
4,0,0,Yes, the hoodie stays on. Now let's drop it.
4,0,0,I think that hood may prove detrimental.
2,0,2,I know you feel cheated, but demanding the death penalty in this case is, frankly, absurd.
1,2,1,Try not to look so grim when the jury enters.
1,2,0,We'll have to move to a state that allows death
2,1,0,Don't worry...the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,this would be easier to defend if she didn't have a scythe in her head
4,0,0,You feel a draft?
3,0,1,How about, “His hands are so brittle; you must vote acquittal”?
4,0,0,Bad news. You're getting a life sentence.
3,1,0,The prosecution is requesting self-imposed punishment.
3,1,0,releasing all the Panama Papers....too much?
3,1,0,Okay tomorrow wear a 3 piece suit
3,0,0,And in any plea bargain, you prefer the death penalty to community service?
4,0,0,I can't let you take the stand. If the jury sees that you are faceless, they may jump to conclusions."
4,0,0,I got them to drop the death penalty.
4,0,0,Look, I'm the editor of this magazine, and I get to say which stories get killed. Case dismissed.
4,0,0,What's with the outfit? Do you have a death wish?
3,0,0,I stacked the jury with Millennials.
2,0,1,Are you certain that you're certain?
4,0,0,I think you should take the deal.
4,0,0,You've got nothing to hide.
3,0,0,There is no plea of 'kinda guilty'.
4,0,0,Tell them you can't take the whole day off.
4,0,0,No, I don't think your smile is what's making the jury uncomfortable.
4,0,0,Just think of it as a holiday.
4,0,0,Big mouth!
4,0,0,You've been sentenced to life in a monastery with no chance of becoming an abbot.
4,0,0,What's the worst they can give me?
2,1,0,Dont worry, in this state they can't penalize you.
4,0,0,Relax--he's a hanging judge.
3,1,0,What are you doing here? The death penalty is supposed to be for the poor and people of color.
4,0,0,Really?
4,0,0,No, killing the judge right now would not be looked upon favorably by the jury.
4,0,0,What do you mean you feel like a dead man sitting?
3,1,0,It's not a jury of your peers, but a jury of their fears.
3,1,0,To tell you the truth, I don't know how they would handle the death penalty in your case.
3,1,0,They're sentencing you to you.
2,1,0,That could be anyone in a black hoodie.
3,1,0,It looks like the jury wants to give you life.
3,1,0,Your image problem is killing us.
2,2,0,Good news--they'll settle for a restraining order.
0,3,1,No, there is no glove you can try to put on.
4,0,0,1. Maybe second chair on a tax evasion case is just too symbolically challenging for this jury? 2. "Supreme" appointment or not, that still doesn't explain how you got this nomination hearing before the election?
4,0,0,If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times: you reap what you sow.
3,0,0,They aren't too lenient with habitual offenders...
4,0,0,Try to smile when you're on the stand.
4,0,0,Death penalty? You’ll have to be more specific.
2,0,1,I'm sorry, but they want you to do life.
4,0,0,Did you have to wear a hoodie?
2,2,0,Like I said, you can’t plead 'its my job.'
3,1,0,I don't think wearing a hoodie to court was the smartest move.
2,1,0,If you take the deal, I can get you life.
3,1,0,I think it's time to put a scare into juror number three.
3,0,0,I'm sorry the verdict didn't allow you to save face.
1,3,0,Look on the bright side. There are no eyewitnesses.
1,2,0,Their not buying your "Devil made me do it" defense. What else ya got?
3,1,0,Remember, you can't face the jury.
3,1,0,This is going to be awkward when they tell you to face the jury during sentencing.
4,0,0,I think maybe we should consider the pleas bargain.
1,2,1,The only way you will get the jury to like you is if you take out Shkreli.
4,0,0,They're going to have a devil of a time making a positive ID.
1,2,0,Remember, this is just a formality.
1,2,1,It doesn't help that you look like hell.
2,0,0,I think they'll be going for a life sentence.
3,0,0,The title of the song was "Eyes Without a Face." Doesn't apply.
3,0,0,If we play our cards right, Mr. Reaper, you'll get off scot-free with a death sentence.
2,2,0,When you're on the stand remember, it was Jimmy's scythe
2,1,0,Trust me, you cant be identified.
2,1,1,Listen--if you want to have a shot with the jury, you've gotta drop the hoodie.
3,0,1,Would it have killed you to have worn a suit?
2,1,0,I think the prosecutor is gonna offer a plea bargain for life.
3,0,1,Right now it's a divorce case. Come back later.
4,0,0,Ask for an appeal? Isn't that just a touch hypocritical?" "I don't think 'Just doing my job' will hold up in court.
4,0,0,You're fired, Counselor, I need a fresh face.
2,1,0,The judge says it's the worst case of identity theft he's ever seen .
3,1,0,We'll at least I can assure you.... you won't get the death penalty.
4,0,0,I don't think you should wear the Witness Protection Program garb until after the trial.
3,1,0,They want to know who issued your scythe license.
4,0,0,You think we need to talk about reconsidering MY defense strategy? Well, I think we first need to talk about reconsidering YOUR outfit.
1,2,1,Your sunny disposition isn't gonna win this one for us.
2,1,0,Good news is the EMTs brought your victim back, so the charge is reduced from first degree murder to attempted murder. Bad news is with your prior record, you're looking at a pretty stiff sentence.
1,1,2,We'll argue the death penalty is a conflict of interest.
3,0,0,Don't worry, you'll get off, even I don't recognize you!
4,0,0,Yes, pleading guilty will get you life. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,I already told you, pleading innocent AND having accidental involvement with everyone on these lists, isn't something that just 'might vibe okay' with the jury.
4,0,0,I see . . I see . . I don't really see . .
4,0,0,Trust me, the jury thinks they are already in Hell.
3,1,0,I told you to ditch the hoodie.
3,0,1,Remember, you've never seen that scythe in your life.
3,0,1,I'm going for the death sentence. It's your only way out.
4,0,0,Next time if you want to skip the trial and get straight to the juicy bits go over to Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
4,0,0,The Force is not with you on this.
1,2,1,I would advise that you describe your relationship with the victim as strictly professional.
3,1,0,Don't worry, there's no death penalty.
3,1,0,Would wearing a suit and a tie to court kill you?
3,1,0,Traces of your DNA have not only been found at the scene of this murder, but at every murder ever.
4,0,0,I don't care what Donald Trump said. I'm your attorney. Don't take the stand.
4,0,0,Yes, I'm certain that these are my taxes...why?
3,0,0,I think we have a ghost of chance at least !
3,1,0,They're not buying that it was an accident.
3,0,1,I should have said more like what -I- would wear to work.
2,2,0,Once again, let me start by asking you to *not* visit the judge.
4,0,0,In your case, a death penalty is redundant.
4,0,0,We're definitely going to need additional counsel for the penalty phase.
3,0,1,How about if we just let him think he's the final judge?
4,0,0,If you could just put a face on the argument. . .
4,0,0,Am I the Victim, or the Defendant?
3,1,0,I'm not sure self-defense is our best option here.
4,0,0,A penalty? Is it really?
4,0,0,Stabbed by hooded farmer is no longer considered natural causes.
4,0,0,I am done with robo-advisors
2,2,0,If they ask what you do for a living, ix-nay on the eth-day.
3,1,0,I suggest you take the Fifth.
4,0,0,I want to help you, but when I say to give up the hoodie for a suit--just this once--that's what I mean.
4,0,0,I thought I told you to wear a tie.
2,2,0,What is this Ebeneezer Scrooge guy going to testify about?
4,0,0,So far, all of the evidence presented against you is only circumstantial.
3,1,0,As your lawyer I advise you to plead the fifth.
4,0,0,How empty do you think I feel?
1,2,0,No. I wouldn't suggest you try to make eye contact with the jurors.
4,0,0,You will need to convince the jury that you're sorry and will never do it again.
4,0,0,Don't look so grim, you reap what you sow!
4,0,0,Nah nah nah nah nah are not mitigating circumstances.
4,0,0,They'll never take your story at face value.
3,1,0,Kris Kringle won his case!
3,1,0,The death penalty suits you.
4,0,0,Too late, your low profile is not helping us at this stage of the process.
4,0,0,So you come as the angel of death to avoid doing your taxes.
4,0,0,For the last time, this is traffic court. I cannot request the death penalty.
3,1,0,Not exactly what I meant when I said you had to face off with the Judge today....
4,0,0,Could you not have worn something else to the hearing?
4,0,0,For the last time, pleading "death sentence" is not an option!
4,0,0,I'm sorry you had to check your scythe but, trust me, it's for the best.
3,1,0,I don't think the judge will accept 'just kidding' as a plea.
3,1,0,Lose the blank stare.
2,2,0,The plaintiff is having trouble facing you.
1,0,1,Don't worry about losing face, just plead guilty!
4,0,0,Well, your acquittal was a safe bet after we reassembled the O.J. jury.
3,0,0,I thought I told you, evidence from face recognition software isn't admissible.
4,0,0,I know you had your heart set on the kids...
2,2,0,I have to be honest, the outlook is grim.
3,0,0,Your look is not helping our case.
4,0,0,If only Ted Cruz had won the election.
3,0,0,Take off your hood or they'll think you're black.
3,1,0,I'd say your case has all kinds of holes in it.
4,0,0,I strongly suggest you face this head on.
3,0,1,I'm afraid the jury doesn't like the look of you either.
4,0,0,I take it that the death penalty is not going to be an issue.
2,1,0,They're bailiffs at every door, there's no escaping, Death.
2,2,0,Trust me, the scythe wouldn't have played well with this jury.
2,2,0,The death penalty is our best chance to get you home.
4,0,0,Do you still have that buddy that can help you cheat death?
2,0,1,Let's leave jury selection to me.
3,0,0,I get the feeling that everyone else in the courtroom is just for show.
3,1,0,"Are you here for the vacancy"?
4,0,0,Here we are... Death and Taxes
3,1,0,Well, if we lose, you should be able to slip through the bars.
4,0,0,Now's the time for some serious soul-searching?
3,1,0,I wanted to let you know that I have really enjoyed this internship.
4,0,0,If the hoodie doesn't fit, acquit.
3,1,0,Between you and me, it's hard defending someone who brings a scythe into the courtroom...
3,1,0,As your attorney I must caution you. You could get life.
3,1,0,so, in this case, the prosecutor is willing to make a plea bargain.
4,0,0,What's the difference between a sickle and a scythe again?
3,1,0,They found the scythe.
3,0,0,Here's the good news, you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,0,I said "coat and tie," not "cloak and scythe."
4,0,0,I'll represent you pro bono in exchange for air conditioning and reduced sulfur.
4,0,0,The Big Guy upstairs sends thoughts and prayers....the guy downstairs sends me.
2,2,0,So, you are OK with the death penalty?
4,0,0,Wrong, I am the voice of reason.
3,1,0,I'd say your best bet is to remain silent.
3,0,1,I KNOW it says a 'jury of your peers', but ...
3,0,0,If your priority is the scythe, I'm afraid she's gonna take all of the pale horse.
3,1,0,Of course we will appeal if your given a "life" sentence.
4,0,0,They're demanding complete transparency.
3,1,0,Yes, I DO find it ironic that you'll be carrying out your own sentence.
4,0,0,No, we're hoping they're hung, not hanged.
4,0,0,Well, it is a scythe, so technically ax evasion isn't a completely erroneous charge.
3,0,1,I'm not going to lie - things look pretty grim.
4,0,0,Don't worry, they couldn't pick you out of the lineup!
3,0,1,Yes, but, 'Death comes for all' is not a legal defense.
4,0,0,What do you mean YOU want to make the closing statement?
4,0,0,Eye contact with the jury is normally a good thing but the unblinking stare with eyes glowing like red hot coals is becoming counterproductive.
2,2,0,Waaaait a second...have you been saying REAP all this time??!
4,0,0,To be honest, our chances of winning this case are looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,It is going to come down to whether the mask fits.
3,1,0,You understand what I mean when I say 'a hung jury would be a great outcome for us,' right?
2,2,0,I AM the death penalty
2,2,0,Your Honor, Death pleads Guilty to tax evasion.
2,1,1,Trust me; loose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Well, I'll be damned. You're telling me that you didn't file your taxes?
3,0,1,And you're certain that you submitted the 1040 on time?
3,1,0,Things are looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,Remember, keep your answers short and I'll lighten things up on redirect.
3,1,0,Since this is your first trial for the firm, I will tell you when to go for the kill.
3,1,0,We're trying to get the scythe found at the scene ruled inadmissible.
3,1,0,When I call you to the stand, leave the scythe under the table, OK?
2,1,1,I can plea bargain for you to avoid yourself.
3,1,0,Good news. I got you the death penalty.
3,1,0,If you let her live, she'll let you keep the beach house.
1,2,0,Eternity seems a little harsh…Can’t we can plea bargain down to time served in hell?
3,0,1,We’re hoping for life.
4,0,0,Our only defense is..the devil is in the details
3,0,1,They didn't see your face so I think we're OK
2,1,0,It's looking grim. You'll probably get life.
3,1,0,Tomorrow I think you should go with the orange jumpsuit.
4,0,0,I'm a lawyer, not a magician
4,0,0,You're not helping your case by laughing at the judge when he brings up the death penalty.
3,1,0,The guilty verdict is disappointing, but I'm pleased with the death sentence.
4,0,0,Are you sure you want to deliver the alimony in person every month?
3,1,0,We can always ask for more time.
3,0,1,Before you get all excited, that's not what a "hung jury" means.
2,2,0,Let me explain how the death penalty works.
4,0,0,You should be prepared for a life sentence.
4,0,0,No, you can't claim Habeas Corpses.
2,1,1,You know your reputation isn't helping here, right?
3,0,0,Ask Johnnie Cochran if we should play the race card.
4,0,0,Dead or not, Issa will still go after you.
4,0,0,You'd be lucky to get life without parole...
4,0,0,Remember, if the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
4,0,0,Taxes? Are you certain?
4,0,0,I won't lie to you. The jury's got that death look showing.
3,1,0,Doc, you wouldn't recognize me anyway. You were too busy entering data into the computer.
4,0,0,What the face !!!!!!!!????
3,1,0,It's a hung jury...literally.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but it seems that you are still liable despite being dead.
3,1,0,We've got em.....with double jeopardy.
3,1,0,There is no way this year gets any worse.
4,0,0,So, you say you were at your club playing squash.
4,0,0,Technically, any sentence is a Death penalty.
3,1,0,I'll be using the "Because she could not stop" defense.
4,0,0,I suppose that an appeal is unlikely.
3,1,0,Normally I'd say lose the hoodie...
3,0,0,Really, George. You want to push for the death penalty again?
3,0,0,When you asked me if I was pro bono, this is not what I had in mind.
4,0,0,Take the plea deal and I might be able to reduce your death sentence.
3,1,0,How many skeletons do you have in your closet?
4,0,0,Don't count on a sympathetic jury.
4,0,0,I still think the non--existence plea is your best shot.
3,1,0,The reason the trial is being delayed is that something seems to have happened to the prosecutor.
3,1,0,Don't touch me, Grim!
3,1,0,I have to be honest, it's going to be very hard for you to get a fair trial here in Florida.
1,2,0,You say it's pronounced "Deeth?"
4,0,0,No, I don't think "More Cow Bell" will help
4,0,0,I'm certain, you will have to pay the taxes.
4,0,0,I know you're facing the death penalty, but in your case I think we can risk a jury trial.
4,0,0,Death penalty? Big whoop.
4,0,0,If it's any consolation, I believe you're innocent.
2,2,0,I'll try to get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,So you are sayo that you want the death penalty !?
2,0,0,I'm afraid your case is totally specious.
4,0,0,If you testify, it will difficult to avoid a death sentence.
3,1,0,Good work. They’re looking for a scythe instead of a 38.
3,0,1,Are you the habaes or the corpus?
4,0,0,I told you, be not proud. Juries hate that.
3,0,0,We're trying to get you life.
3,1,0,This is going to be a slam dunk, just look at the judge and point!
3,0,1,I think I'd like a new tax attorney
2,0,2,Eternal damnation seems reasonable
2,1,0,Nobody's ever tried to plea-bargain for the death penalty!
3,1,0,Don't mention.the kissing
3,0,1,We need to get the jury to like you.
3,0,1,My best advice? Be not proud.
2,1,0,We can't just ask for the death penalty as our first motion.
3,1,0,No, the State won't let you self-administer.
1,2,0,They'll drop the charges if you help with these 7,000 cold cases.
3,1,0,Your testimony was a bit hollow.
4,0,0,It's looking grim.
3,1,0,For the last time, traffic violations don't warrant the death penalty.
4,0,0,I still need some documents proving that it is indeed your playground.
4,0,0,Just testify that "the devil made you do it".
3,0,1,Try smiling.
3,1,0,I thought we talked about this. The jury doesn't like hoodies.
4,0,0,I'm going to recommend the death penalty
3,1,0,Good news, I got a plea bargain to throw out the death penalty.
3,1,0,Don't you think we're laying it on a little thick?
3,1,0,'I was only doing my job,' probably won't help much.
3,0,0,Remember, you didn't see nothing, hear nothing, or do nothing, you weren't even there.
3,0,1,You have got to tell me now. Do you ever carry a scythe?
4,0,0,This does end well for you
4,0,0,I advise you to take the Fifth.
2,2,0,I hear you, I just think the death penalty is going to be a stretch for jaywalking.
3,1,0,So you think we should go for the death penalty?
2,2,0,Did anyone see you in Samarra?
4,0,0,This is a bankruptcy case. My client isn't a great guy, but his ex-wife can't demand the death penalty.
3,0,0,They have to acquit. The sickle doesn't fit.
3,1,0,I am not putting you on the stand!
4,0,0,The scythe was frightening the jury.
2,0,0,We may be looking at life!
4,0,0,Worse case scenario; you get the death penalty.
3,1,0,They don't care that it was just a traffic violation, they want to give you the Death penalty.
4,0,0,Death was told to relax, for he knew the security cameras didn’t capture his face.
3,1,0,I tried but they won't take the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,I thought I told you to suit up!
4,0,0,Fidel who?
3,0,0,I'd say...a ghost of a chance...but.. no worries about the death penalty.
2,0,1,Don't be so grim, I still have two more kids to put through College
4,0,0,This isn't what I meant when I said to dress like you were attending a funeral.
3,1,0,'Here's your alibi: all afternoon, you were in Times Square posing for photos with tourists.'
2,2,0,I convinced the judge that the death penalty would create a conflict of interest.
4,0,0,Don't take the deal. I mean, what's the worst that could happen "The Death Penality?"
3,1,0,How do I send the bill, to the campaign or him personally?
3,1,0,Let's talk about your body language.
4,0,0,Frankly, I don't think we have a ghost of a chance.
4,0,0,Sorry, apparently pre-reapering is a crime.
2,1,1,The defense rests... FOREVER!
4,0,0,Look cheerful.
2,2,0,You didn't tell me you had actual skeletons in your closet.
2,1,0,It's not looking good. The prosecution has you on 100 billion counts of homicide.
3,1,0,And how do you see yourself now, Mr Presley?
4,0,0,She also wants your scythe.
4,0,0,If I've told you once, I've told you a 1,000 times, juries never trust a blank expression.
4,0,0,I think we should ask for the death penalty
3,1,0,Because of double jeopardy, there is no chance for the death penalty.
4,0,0,We'll have to plea bargain.
3,0,1,You got "life." Tragic, yes, but amusingly ironic.
3,1,0,We can't lose. You're eternal.
3,1,0,Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not going to put you on the stand.
1,1,1,Don't worry—You'll fit right in on death row.
3,1,0,The hoodie makes you look guilty.
3,0,0,You face 55 million counts from last year alone.
4,0,0,I don't think the jury wants to convict you.
1,1,2,There's no denying you were at the scene of the crime.
3,1,0,We've only a ghost of a chance.
4,0,0,We maybe able to use this in your defense. Tell the truth. Did you want to be the Unabomber or Dopey?
3,1,0,I'm counting on you. You're our star witness for re-instituting the death penalty.
3,0,1,Please just stop with the, "I am death," speech. Okay?
4,0,0,So this is the hoodie with the six-month wait list that everyone is talking about?
3,1,0,Why are you always so grim about everything??
4,0,0,Let's take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,A life sentence? You're being ironic, right?
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I don't think that hoodie helps your image with the jury.
4,0,0,Concurrent or consecutive sentences: does it matter?
4,0,0,Just be quiet, sit still, and try an look innocent...
3,0,1,Why can't you tell them who's on first?
2,2,0,Hang on, I've got a killer objection to make.
4,0,0,They took the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,It's good news...you got life.
2,2,0,You could be sentenced to life.
4,0,0,I am afraid the prognosis is grim.
2,2,0,I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, "You were just doing your job" is not a defense we can win with.
3,0,0,My shrink tells me that they are naming the new syndrome after me!
3,1,0,It doesn't matter, they still consider it a penalty.
4,0,0,We're calling Dick Cheney as character witness.
3,0,0,Why don't you take this witness?
4,0,0,It may well be his "time" but taking the judge now isn't going to help your case one bit.
3,1,0,Just to recap: you did it, you'll keep doing it and that's that?
4,0,0,I'm guessing this has something to do with Operation Car Wash!
3,1,0,My guess is they'll vote for the one named after you.
4,0,0,Keep it up and the outcome will be grim, too.
4,0,0,Have you ever worked on a capital punishment case before?
4,0,0,Dressing business casual may not help our case.
2,0,2,You've hung all the jury.
3,0,0,Next time wear white, it's your only hope!
3,1,0,Remember not to smile at the jury
3,1,0,I hear orange is the new black
2,2,0,Habeas corpus won't be a problem.
4,0,0,I'll put you on the stand to prove you're innocent if you'll change out of the clothes you wore when you committed the crime.
3,1,0,So you made that yourself?
3,1,0,Hello. Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?
3,1,0,You may want take the 5th.
4,0,0,So you thought he said "today" rather than "not today"?
3,0,1,If the sickle doesn't fit, they must acquit.
3,1,0,'Tag, you're it' is not a very good defense.
3,1,0,Eventually you will need to show up in person.
4,0,0,Why can't I wear exhibit A, It's mine?
3,0,1,Well, the jury really heard our expert on the constitutional right to own and use a scythe, and I think it would be a huge mistake to put you on the stand.
3,1,0,The defense calls Al Cowlings to the stand.
4,0,0,Yes, so these claims go all the way back to the beginning of time; it turns out there is no statute of limitations for what you did.
4,0,0,At this time, I'd like to call the court's attention to my client's long history of charitable works in the community.
3,1,0,I don't think we can plead lack of intent.
3,0,0,I'd advise against asking the judge whether your hoodie makes your face look fat.
1,2,0,When you glance at the jurors you need to look less grim.
3,1,0,Trust me; she'll get custody.
2,1,1,Habeas Corpus? Seriously?!?
3,1,0,Can't you just hang the jury?
3,1,0,No. You can't plead irony to a death sentence.
3,0,1,You want a change of venue to where?
3,0,0,We've met before at that dreadful mixer at Skidmore in '04.
4,0,0,I think it's time we introduce your sting.
2,0,1,I told you the judge would not appreciate you wearing a matching robe.
3,1,0,Bad news. Taxes is turning state's evidence.
4,0,0,Yes, they were all dead when I got there. All 107 billion of them.
4,0,0,That isn't what I meant by 'business attire.'
3,1,0,Look the jury in their souls.
3,1,0,Tax evasion? Really?
3,1,0,Shut your hole. If they want to call it a penalty, let them call it a penalty.
4,0,0,Listen, I have to level with you. I'm not accredited.
3,0,1,I thought we talked about not wearing the hoodie.
0,1,3,We're unable to find a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,Whatever you do, don't look up.
2,2,0,All things considered, 30 years isn't so bad.
3,1,0,The ruling is final; you will be replaced by 2017
3,1,0,I believe you that no one tips the ferryman. It's the IRS who thinks you're under-reporting.
4,0,0,Again, the death penalty does not hold for loitering.
4,0,0,You want me to plead guilty AND ask for the death penalty?
4,0,0,Habeus corpus? What's that?
3,1,0,Next year you should just pay your taxes
3,0,0,You ARE entitled to compensation for the unlawful use of the phrase 'Death' penalty.
4,0,0,Looks bad, we've got a ghost of a chance of winning this case.
4,0,0,We can plea bargain down to manslaughter.
4,0,0,Don't worry, the worst you can get is death.
4,0,0,As your attorney I'd advise you to lighten up a bit.
1,3,0,Try to connect with the jury.
4,0,0,Trust me, no one will ever vote to convict.
4,0,0,Don't stare, but don't avoid eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,I just got off the phone with the D.A. She said she'll put the death penalty back on the table, if that's what you really want.
1,0,2,If only you'd had a license to scythe
3,1,0,The judge wants to know what your reaction to a death penalty would be?
3,1,0,Death, be not proud-especially when you take the stand...
2,2,0,I don't think changing your name from "Grim" to "Wonderful" is going to influence the jury.
4,0,0,Look, I told you she'd take you to the cleaners in the divorce. Be happy you still have your job.
4,0,0,What? I just got this dry cleaned.
4,0,0,Just be yourself - Death Eaters have rights too.
4,0,0,I feel it's prudent to argue "wrongful death.
4,0,0,My stylist told me to wear blue but I really think my signature color will play better with the jury
3,0,1,Your prospects appear grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Let me get this straight- you plea-bargained for the death penalty?
3,1,0,I should have known — everyone objects to Death.
3,0,1,In the event that it's even possible, be sure to never make eye contact with any juror.
4,0,0,You can't change your plea hoping for a life sentence. The death penalty is still on the table.
2,0,2,You really gotta stop making eye contact with the jury.
3,1,0,They couldn't come up with a jury of your peers, so we're going with a bunch of Trump supporters.
4,0,0,I don't think there's a bulk discount.
2,1,0,Face it, the grim truth is you're guilty.
2,2,0,We might have a problem getting the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Remember, you're only here as an expert witness on mortality.
3,1,0,Looks like another hung jury.
1,3,0,I wouldn't worry about the penalty phase.
3,1,0,Luckily, they can't extend prison sentences to eternity.
3,1,0,"We've got this - no one's ever cheated you yet.
3,0,1,I think you should have gone with a navy blazer.
2,2,0,Ix-nay on the 'D' word.
2,1,0,Please tell me you're here to be my pro bono client.
2,1,0,I can't believe you were picked from a line-up.
4,0,0,The prosecution is pushing for the life penalty.
4,0,0,Yes, I told you to wear a dark suit, but don't you have something less grim ?
2,0,0,Well, I'm done here. Now about that invoice
4,0,0,We're going to tell the court you weren't there.
3,1,0,D.A.claims your alibi "sounds hollow" !
4,0,0,Trust me, changing your name to "Morose Reaper" will endear you to this jury!
3,1,0,That's not what I meant by "capping the testimony."
4,0,0,Trust me on this. Loose the Hoodie!
3,1,0,We can't excuse those who oppose the death penalty. You are the death penalty.
4,0,0,For God's sake Terrence, all you did was shoplift!
4,0,0,You'll still get visitation rights.
3,1,0,No, we can't plead this out to get a life sentence.
2,2,0,As your attorney, I must warn you that the hoodie may give the jury the wrong impression.
3,1,0,Don't worry. There's no death penalty in this state.
4,0,0,What made you think the sickle would get through security?
4,0,0,On second thought, I'll represent myself.
3,0,0,I told you yesterday the judge does not approve of hoodies.
4,0,0,What?! you don*t have a VISA card??
3,1,0,I already told, I'm not playing Devil's advocate on this.
4,0,0,I'm not sure 'temporary invisibility' is a valid plea.
4,0,0,Sorry, but I couldn't get a dead person on the jury.
2,2,0,Given the number of victims, I don't think we can expect much leniency.
3,1,0,Your choice of clothing will not help our case.
4,0,0,I'm going to put you on the stand tomorrow Ralph.However, I wan;t you to go home and do something about your hands.
3,0,1,Just so I'm clear, your alibi is you were killing someone else at the time of the murder?
3,0,0,What's the trick to holding up that hood?
3,1,0,The airhead defense is better than the Fifth.
2,1,0,They won't give you the death penalty shoplifting a scythe.
4,0,0,Take the deal. You can do death row standing on your head.
3,1,0,Make eye contact with the jury.
3,0,1,This isn't going to be easy--you're a repeat offender.
3,0,0,This court is not the right place for you coming out.
3,1,0,They are confused about who represents death.
3,1,0,For tomorrow, I'd suggest the light gray pin-stripe with a red tie.
3,1,0,I told you to stop pointing at Juror #5.
3,1,0,Wipe that guilty look off your face.
2,2,0,Mr. Reaper, the judge is going to send you away for a long time unless you send him away for a long time...if you get my drift.
0,2,1,Just don't point at anyone.
4,0,0,How ironic if you were to get a life sentence.
2,2,0,I am sure the scythe is fine, just keep track of your claim ticket.
3,0,0,Death is different.
4,0,0,I think if we plead now, we can avoid the you penalty.
3,0,0,But you told me to come dressed to kill.
3,1,0,There IS a difference between natural death and murder.
3,1,0,Just be yourself, you have nothing to hide.
4,0,0,The only thing certain would have been Scalia.
3,1,0,I think it will be abundantly clear to the jury that growing up in the 'hood had a big impact on your identity formation.
3,1,0,You want a change of venue? How's Pluto? Is Pluto good?
0,3,1,It doesn't matter if it is for your job, no contact means no contact.
4,0,0,You're facing the death penalty.
3,1,0,Your priors make things a bit tricky, but this is a clear case of tortious interference with trade.
3,0,0,Is that blank stare is working for you?
4,0,0,Is there any way you can make eye contact when you testify?
4,0,0,We can't ask for a continuance. This is a tax case.
4,0,0,Putting you on the witness stand is probably a bad idea.
3,0,0,No, I don't think they'll buy it was a mutual mistake
3,1,0,Great, give them the vacant look when they ask you where you were the night of the murder.
1,3,0,Finding a jury of your peers was hell.
1,2,0,It's a death penalty case. You win either way.
4,0,0,Any words of optimism
4,0,0,To win this case you'll have to remove the hoodie!
3,1,0,I'm going to do everything I can to at least get you out of having to pay taxes.
3,0,1,'Now look, that makes two judges, four jury members and one bailiff. I think they get your message, OK ?'
3,1,0,If you're found guilty, are we still good?
4,0,0,They think that you should have had the foresight to not look in the rear view mirror.
4,0,0,How are things in Braavos?
2,2,0,The brothers will accept $50,000 and you agree to be called simply "The Reaper" from now on.
2,1,0,You can't plea bargain a death sentence for a parking ticket.
2,2,0,I know there's nothing wrong with a hoodie, but could you try to wear a suit when you testify?
3,1,0,I'm sorry—it looks like a life sentence.
2,2,0,Hung Jury is just an expression.
2,2,0,The judge would like you to stop "dismissing" jurors
2,2,0,You might want to ditch the hoodie
3,1,0,You were right, we have a hung jury.
4,0,0,You think black holes are for real?
3,1,0,"Keep a poker face".
4,0,0,Lawyer: did you kill this man Death: No Donald Trumps views on America did
4,0,0,Are you arguing for, or against?
3,1,0,Personally, I don't thick they can touch you.
4,0,0,At this point, I think you should take the deal.
3,0,0,C'mon, man . . . the trial hasn't even started!
4,0,0,What's an appeal? Well...
3,0,1,Look, it's nothing personal, that's just what the penalty is called.
3,1,0,Are you sure you want to go through with this case?
4,0,0,Don't worry. They will never recognize you in that disguise.
4,0,0,Reaper has an eco-feel to it, but the grim as got to go.
4,0,0,You have the right to remain faceless.
4,0,0,Noo, I'm Emile Dickinson.
4,0,0,When I put you on the stand, don't look so grim.
2,2,0,Your chances would improve if you wore a tie.
2,2,0,We're trying to put a good face on your case.
2,1,0,What do you mean you don't believe in the death penalty?
4,0,0,We may want to reconsider our self-defense plea.
4,0,0,The prospect of a favorable judgment looks grim, which wont come as a surprise to you.
3,0,1,Don't worry. All they care about is the Panama accounts.
2,2,0,Character witnesses may be an issue.
4,0,0,Maybe you should look in the mirror. The death penalty looks inevitable in this case.
3,1,0,No, the judge is offering YOU a plea bargain.
4,0,0,By the way, where do I send your bill?
2,2,0,If we win is it possible to add a few more years to my life?
4,0,0,I know we're not supposed to get personal here, but my wife would like to know how her mother is doing.
4,0,0,Stop snickering. The death penalty is a real thing.
4,0,0,Now they've got some character witness who says you hustled him at chess.
3,1,0,It's habeas corpus, not habeas corpse.
1,2,0,Relax. Last year I got the Four Horsemen off with nothing more than probation.
4,0,0,It's just as we feared. They're going for the YOU penalty.
2,2,0,I wouldn't take the plea. It's life without parole.
4,0,0,There is no legal president for striking a plea deal for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Don't let her rattle you.
4,0,0,Because you are already dead life in prison and lethal injection are not options. However, the judge may choose unlimited duration community service at a New Jersey toll booth.
4,0,0,Just to let you know, they're seeking the death penalty.
2,0,2,I'm not going to lie, it's starting to look a little grim.
3,0,0,You're giving me mixed signals - how do you plead?
3,1,0,In your case the death penalty is beyond ironic.
4,0,0,The fact that you didn't shave should not affect the outcome.
4,0,0,Look Mr. Reaper, the DA said "involuntary manslaughter" is still on the table. I suggest you take the deal.
4,0,0,They are not accepting your plea that you just lost your head.
4,0,0,We plead not guilty on the grounds of mistaken identity
3,0,1,The death sentence is off the table.
4,0,0,We hate your message, but your right as messenger is protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution!
4,0,0,MR. REAPER, I told you security would take your scythe.
4,0,0,Could it be the New Yorker is "not good?"
3,1,0,You've been sentenced to life. Don't ask me.
4,0,0,This is a life or death situation.
4,0,0,The whole "'till death do us part" thing didn't seem to work so well for us this time.
4,0,0,No, I don't think they will charge you for every human since the beginning of time.
3,1,0,What do you mean; "what's my date of birth"?
4,0,0,Don't you think the death penalty is a bit harsh?
3,0,0,I'll waive all legal fees if you agree not to see me again for a long, long time.
4,0,0,Keep in mind: O.J. was acquitted.
4,0,0,Do you know the meaning of a "hung jury" ?
4,0,0,You ever heard the expression, "dead right"? I didn't think so, take the offer.
2,2,0,I am afraid I will not be be able to represent you post-mortem
4,0,0,you'l have to get a suit, only the judge can wear a robe in court
3,1,0,They've given you two minutes for high-sticking.
4,0,0,Who says you can't take the scythe into chambers?
3,1,0,Yes, I’d say it DOES look bad for you.
4,0,0,Ok, we’ll make a go at it, but you shouldn't really count on a sympathetic jury.
4,0,0,At this time the defense rests.
4,0,0,Remember to wipe that silly grin off your face when you are on the stand.
0,2,2,Your priors are going to be a problem.
4,0,0,Try to inject a bit more life into your testimony.
2,2,0,To get a reduced sentence, you'll have to tell the court where all the bodies are buried.
3,1,0,You may get life.
4,0,0,Well, Justice is blind, so I guess the whole invisibility thing is moot.
4,0,0,The judge was lenient. You got the death penalty.
3,1,0,It's ok, we're claiming it's required by your religious beliefs
3,1,0,Don't point!
2,2,0,I know its not a jury of your peers...
4,0,0,Do you think a softer colored robe would humanize me to the jury?
2,2,0,Let's just hope for a hung jury.
4,0,0,I'm not sure that your claim that you are the Grim Reaper is going to clear you of a murder one charge.
3,1,0,At least try to look remorseful?
2,1,0,You're lucky we're in Nebraska, where you're protected by the concealed-scythe law.
4,0,0,If we're going to win this case, you need to lose the hoodie and keep a low profile.
4,0,0,Law and Order: Cybersecurity Unit
4,0,0,Two sugars isn't going to kill me.
4,0,0,Don't complicate this by giving them the death stare.
3,0,0,Ok, fine. I'll plead the 5th.
4,0,0,we'll call your scythe as the next witness
4,0,0,Are you sure they didn't see you?
4,0,0,Remember, if it doesn't fit, they must acquit.
4,0,0,I don't think they'll give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,For the last time, we're not calling Blue Oyster Cult as a character witness!
2,0,1,But you never actually killed anybody, right?
3,0,1,They're deliberating the Death sentence.
3,0,0,Sorry, your visitation rights are looking rather grim.
3,1,0,My fee is contingent.
4,0,0,You are not in witness protection yet.
3,1,0,Say what you always say. Tell them exactly what happens.
4,0,0,They want you to serve life.
2,1,1,All of our witnesses are dead.
2,1,0,We are going to contend it was part of your job description.
2,1,0,No worries. There appears to be no witnesses left.
3,0,0,Take it or leave it. That's my final offer.
2,1,0,Perhaps you misunderstood the term "Jury Deadlock?"
2,1,1,No, I don't think the robe makes you look "judicial."
3,1,0,Y'know you are going to have to face up to this some time.
2,2,0,So, let me get this right, you WANT the death penalty?
2,0,0,The tip is included, if I remember.
4,0,0,Just let me do the talking, please.
3,1,0,I try and get you life.
3,0,0,So...Let me get this straight. ,You want all the royalties from a song, using your name, which was sung in the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
4,0,0,I object...can I object?
4,0,0,I didn't say "let's" get rid of Juror No. 7.
4,0,0,Death penalty. Didn't see that one coming'.
3,1,0,A jury of your peers is out of the question. Now just sit there and try not to look like death warmed over!
4,0,0,I suggest a habeas corpus defense.
4,0,0,Would you consider community service in Corrections, just 'til we get this lethal injection thing sorted out?
2,1,1,I think we should be focusing on bigger issues, but the answer to your question is ‘yes’ – if you're cleared of all charges, they will very likely return your scythe.
4,0,0,You have to start reminding people to encrypt their suicide notes.
3,1,0,A death penalty is a reach.
3,1,0,If they ask you about death panels, take the Fifth.
4,0,0,You have to take a plea. Your case is facially defective.
1,1,2,'It was his time'? So we're going with that?
2,2,0,I don't think they'll be seeking the death penalty again.
4,0,0,Your briefs read better than the Joy Of Love !
4,0,0,You're looking at infinite death sentences.
2,0,1,Is that "really" listed on your job description(
3,1,0,The judge won't accept the "trying to find yourself" defense.
2,2,0,I know what you're thinking, but that's not what a "hung jury" means.
4,0,0,Sure, I'm going to close strong--but not that strong.
2,1,0,Losing the scythe is a good start. Now about the hoody.
2,2,0,Try not to look so grim. Juries notice things like that.
3,0,0,I don't care who you are. I still have to execute your case.
4,0,0,To avoid the death penalty, I advise you to accept the plea bargain.
3,0,0,We'll file an appeal, so try not to look so grim.
3,0,1,We will do better without Juror #3, if you know what I mean...
3,0,0,I suggest a different outfit at trial.
4,0,0,Look, Hiram, you can't stay here: the librarian thinks you should be in the prophet section.
3,0,0,Yes, but the irony of your getting the death penalty would be amazing.
3,1,0,But they're just about to announce the verdict...
2,1,1,The case is looking grim.
4,0,0,First of all, in the court of law, "habeas corpus" does not mean "take the body."
4,0,0,I specifically asked you not to wear a hoodie to court.
4,0,0,Lucky for you everyone's wearing them.
1,3,0,When I said 'delete your profile', I meant Facebook.
4,0,0,Don't worry, nobody liked her.
2,1,0,After we're done here can you come with me to visit my mother-in-law?
3,1,0,I'm not sure 'Just doing my job.' is really the best defense here.
4,0,0,You should have told me you once worked for the IRS.
3,0,1,Of course I'm qualified, in my last case I was the Devil's advocate.
4,0,0,I'm not worried. In this county, you always get a jury that's mostly undead.
3,0,0,Sir, the judge will ask you to remove your hood.
4,0,0,Good news - they're offering a face-saving settlement
3,1,0,If they find the sickle.....we're in a pickle.
3,1,0,No, hung jury is actually NOT a good thing
3,0,0,Well, regardless of your "dominion over all", the IRS is still requiring that you pay "all" of those back taxes.
3,1,0,At least it's not a life sentence.
3,1,0,Sympathetic jury? Forget it. I don't care if it is your job, murder is murder, and as your attorney, I'll be seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,He's asking for three more weeks but I think we can get him down to next Tuesday.
2,1,1,Forget about it. He's NOT going to give you life.
2,0,1,I'd say getting the death sentence is a win-win.
3,0,0,Go with the judge. A jury won't order an injunction on a fountain of youth.
4,0,0,It's a capital case! You might have to 'do' yourself, mister I'm so tough!
1,3,0,Don't worry, I was the Devil's Advocate all through law school.
3,1,0,No. No. No. ...No Darth Vader defense.
4,0,0,They asking for the death sentence.
4,0,0,The judge is asking if you are the ghost who walks?
2,1,1,It would really help your case if you could remember where you left your scythe.
3,1,0,I know you want to testify, but I don't think it's a good idea. Did you see the look that juror number 4 gave you?
2,0,0,Go against the 8th if you want. To me, looking at that mole on your hoodie? Cruel, Unusual and DISTURBING, son!
4,0,0,So you will plead guilty as charged for doing your job?
2,1,1,I take it you don't care about the death penalty.
2,1,1,Don't you have a nice blue suit?
2,1,0,That hung jury joke didn't make you any more likable.
2,1,0,You're facing the you penalty
1,3,0,This may not mean much to you, but your facing life.
2,2,0,I know you're experienced, but I'll do the closing.
3,0,0,I prefer my clients to show more optimism!
3,1,0,Worst case? They sentence you to you.
3,1,0,You should take life.
4,0,0,Try to stop smiling every time he says 'death penalty'.
3,1,0,If only we didn't have jurors 3 and 7 ... just sayin'.
4,0,0,Our only chance is a change of venue to hell.
3,0,1,I think the scythe is what killed us.
2,1,1,Good news! Their eye witness testimony might be a problem.
2,0,1,I think I can get it knocked down to aggravated assault.
3,1,0,The hoodie is killing us!
1,2,1,From one lawyer to another.....
3,0,0,You don't recollect, only collect. You may evoke the scythe.
2,2,0,Don't worry... I have a Plan B.
4,0,0,After I ask Ms. Dickinson why she didn't stop, you can tell the jury you kindly did.
2,2,0,Our empty suit approach seems to work.
4,0,0,I hear you, but i can't see what your saying !
1,3,0,Just give her the house and car before she starts bringing up the other stuff.
4,0,0,Must be nice to be able to bill in eons.
3,1,0,No, I agreed only to act as your local counsel.
2,0,0,I'm afraid they are not buying your "I was only doing my job" story.
3,1,0,Look, I won't lie to you. The outlook is grim. But let's face it, you reap what you sow.
4,0,0,Remember your occupation is, "paradigm transition specialist."
3,0,1,Remember your in the witness protection program. Don't give your real name.
3,1,0,And finally, try to smile at the jury.
4,0,0,I thought that ghostwriter was just an expression
3,1,0,Better not. Hoodies have become a presumption of guilt in this courtroom.
3,0,1,If you settle this one everybody's going to sue you.
4,0,0,Death AND taxes?
1,2,1,Well, yes, if one more juror dies it will be a mistrial. Why do you ask?
3,0,0,Can I, Death, really be sentenced to...Death?
3,1,0,You're saying your wife accidentally fell on your scythe?
3,0,1,The penalty is death, but we'll argue for time served.
3,0,0,And no more leading the witness.
1,3,0,I'm with the NRA. We're taking your case pro bono.
1,1,1,You are not required to 'appear' before the Court.
4,0,0,Is this really what it takes to get a hearing from the Republicans?
3,0,1,This time on the stand, try not to look so grim.
4,0,0,Sure they found blood on the scythe and found me holding it over the body but it's not mine!I'm the victim here, really!
4,0,0,You can't deadhead the neighbors pansies with a scythe just because you didn't get Yard of the Month!
4,0,0,Care for a breath mint?
4,0,0,Frankly, grim does'nt cut it.
4,0,0,You left your scythe where?
3,0,0,Just try to sound sympathetic
3,0,1,Considering you are being accused of killing everyone who ever existed, yes, I'm a little concerned.
2,2,0,So, if I win this case, you'll pay a visit to the senior partners?
3,1,0,I don't know why they call it a penalty, I'm actually really fun!
2,1,1,We're gonna get him. I won't see you cheated again.
2,1,0,What we really want is Involuntary.
3,0,1,"It will go better if you don't say "over your dead body" to the judge again.
4,0,0,There's no certainty - this is your trial for tax evasio - oh wait...
3,0,0,I myself have reasonable doubt about your latest alibi.
2,2,0,I'm expecting the life penalty
3,1,0,Don't blame me. I told you to lose the hoodie.
2,2,0,You don't agree with a stay of execution?
3,1,0,We're just going to plead the fifth.
4,0,0,No - it wasn't wise to ask her honour if she feels well.
4,0,0,Wouldn't you rather take the penalty that's named after you?
4,0,0,We're seeking the death penalty.
3,0,0,I don't advise using "the devil made me do it" as an excuse.
2,1,0,I'll do the talking.
4,0,0,Your Honor, you are in the wrong seat.
2,1,1,He says he wants you to stop issuing warrants.
2,2,0,I think you're misunderstanding habeas corpus.
3,1,0,I thought we agreed no hoodie.
4,0,0,Let's switch uniforms and see if it makes a difference.
4,0,0,What do you mean the tie makes me look guilty?
1,2,0,No. I don't think telling them that it's your job is a good idea.
3,1,0,It's the hoodie and your occupation. A clear case of profiling.
3,1,0,I'm sure the prosecution will not go for the death penalty, it would be redundant.
3,1,0,You can't plead "It's my job" to the murder charge.
2,1,0,Remember not to make eye contact with the jury.
3,0,0,I'm telling you, it's face without a name and it's brain over brawn.
3,0,0,Might be a little late for a plea bargain.
4,0,0,Well there's Heaven which provides unlimited texting and there's Hell which prohibits use of all devices. So sir kindly place your phone on the table and follow me.
3,1,0,And keep calm on the stand; remember: no scythe, no proof.
3,1,0,I'm worried the cloak makes you look unsympathetic.
2,1,0,I'm not sure "he was at peace with it" is our best defense.
4,0,0,Well , you reap what sow and no you will not testify !
3,0,0,I think your "It's my job!" explanation is your best bet.
3,1,0,I don't think you have an alibi for the murder.
4,0,0,Try to just be yourself.
4,0,0,We should probably talk about the death penalty.
2,1,0,Did they see your face?
3,1,0,I'm sorry -- they never found your body.
2,2,0,I asked you to wear a tie.
4,0,0,Another drone design flaw in the making
4,0,0,Evidently, Face Time is dead.
4,0,0,It hinges on the context of the term "cheating."
3,1,0,The you penalty is on the table.
3,1,0,I do believe I'm having a near-death experience.
3,1,0,Seriously? Now we have a hung jury.
4,0,0,The judge is not going to like it. I said grey suite not jump suite.
2,1,0,Are you looking for a hung jury?
2,1,0,Are you here for death or taxes?
4,0,0,Don't worry, I've never lost a case on facial insufficiency.
4,0,0,If you took your hood off, you could help your case so much more.
3,1,0,you never should have popped that pimple.
3,0,1,Taking this deal will help eradicate life in prison.
3,1,0,Just try to look innocent.
3,1,0,Yes, I see the irony.
3,1,0,I don't think self-defense is your best argument.
4,0,0,Try to avoid too much "grimness" in your testimony.
4,0,0,I don't think the Doomsday Defense is working.
3,1,0,What do you mean, you never lose?
4,0,0,Yes, I did get Taxes off, but you're not going to be that easy.
3,0,1,I'm afraid that's the sentence, death.
3,0,1,I just found out you got bad news you've been sentenced to Hell!
3,0,0,I told you not to hitch your wagon to the taxman.
4,0,0,If the hood doesn't fit, they must acquit.
0,4,0,I don't see any peers in the jury pool.
3,1,0,You've been indicted on 8 billion counts of homicide.
2,1,1,Worse case scenario, it won't be cruel and unusual for you.
4,0,0,Look, on New Year's Eve with everyone celebrating, a sickle is a dangerous weapon!
4,0,0,Hell is whenever I'm with you.
4,0,0,So you have no objections to an insanity defense?
2,2,0,They want you to try on the glove.
2,0,2,You can't threaten the judge with his soul, George.
3,1,0,Our defense is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
3,1,0,I know you want the death penalty but this is traffic court.
4,0,0,You might want to remove your head covering.
4,0,0,Wearing a gray hoodie really isn't going to help your case.
2,1,1,How many times do we need to go over this? "It was his time to go" is not a sound defense.
1,2,0,For the last time, 'I don't know how to do anything else,' is NOT a defense.
3,1,0,At least you won't have to worry about the death sentence.
3,1,0,No - you don't need a shave!
4,0,0,Let's just hope the jury sees you as a kindly Dementor for helping the prisoners at Azbakan escape.
4,0,0,You cannot ask for the death penalty for your traffic citation.
3,1,0,Apparently, those were the droids they were looking for.
3,1,0,You're being charged with a faceless crime.
4,0,0,Not even the "Dream Team" could have had your priors expunged.
3,1,0,OK. With this judge, "self defense " going to be a tough sell.
2,1,0,You've got a lot of counts against you.
2,2,0,If they ask, you've never seen that scythe before in your life.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, proving you're not guilty on all 11,415,521,778 counts is going to be a challenge.
2,2,0,Well no, technically, it's not a jury of your peers..
2,2,0,Just be yourself.
3,1,0,With this plea, we can get you life in prison instead of the death sentence.
1,2,1,I'm just saying that shouting 'I've got your death penalty right here!' wasn't a great way to start.
3,1,0,Are you willing to be cross examined?
2,1,0,We're having trouble convincing the judge you have PTSD.
3,1,0,Sepulchre? Is that some kind of plea?
3,0,1,Stereotypically speaking, this is not a good look.
2,0,2,I don't think you're getting custody.
3,0,1,What the judge is trying to say - you cant go round killing people willy nilly.
3,0,1,Insider trading...? Really?
3,1,0,Agree to the Settlement. When Life is exhausted, you can take them.
4,0,0,Smile. It will help you connect with the jury.
3,1,0,.. and your telling me THIS now?!?
2,2,0,"Not hung. I said we need a young jury." (italicize "hung" and "young")
4,0,0,You are fortunate that 140 billion are getting thrown out due to the statute of limitations.
3,1,0,The hoodie was not a good idea.
4,0,0,Sorry to disappoint. This is not a capital punishment state
3,0,0,"Yes ironically a "hung jury " would be in our favor.
1,3,0,It wouldn’t hurt to smile a little when you testify.
3,1,0,You of all people should have known that taxes are inevitable!
2,1,1,You've never before had a restraining order?
3,1,0,I'll defend you but you have to stop staring me in the face.
4,0,0,One thing is certain: you're going to have to pay your taxes, Death.
4,0,0,remember to put your best face on for the jury.
4,0,0,Good, with out the Sickle I think we stand a better chance.
2,1,1,..and then if you get Death, how does that work?
4,0,0,No, GR, a life sentence is NOT a good thing.
4,0,0,The judge still resents you for taking his goldfish.
4,0,0,Life in prison or death penalty, does it really matter?
2,2,0,So you can just part us, like, legally, right?
2,1,0,I’ve already told you this, a hung jury is just an expression.
3,1,0,Trust me. I'll get you your continuance.
4,0,0,Well, maybe if you didn't look so grim, we could get the jury on our side.
1,2,1,My client pleads not guilty by reason of inevitability.
4,0,0,Couldn't get a jury of your peers . The morgue was empty
1,2,1,Hey Death, I'm Taxes.
4,0,0,I tried..but when you're dead you're dead !
3,0,1,To win this thing, we'll need to show the jury the sensitive soul behind that horrifying abyss you call a face.
2,2,0,Sure it is all circumstantial but you have to admit you have been present at an awful out of murders
2,2,0,I feel pretty good about our chances for a change of venue.
2,2,0,No, I'm afraid we can't plead inevitability.
3,1,0,I can't touch that Bible. You know that, right?
2,2,0,I'm told the DA really wants to win this one.
3,0,1,I'm so sorry. You're facing life.
4,0,0,If it's any consolation, they named the penalty after you.
2,0,0,Wait - I thought I was here to defend you.
3,0,1,If they give you the death penalty, try not to do your happy dance.
4,0,0,Just to play it safe, let the judge see your face.
2,2,0,Don't worry. The death penalty is illegal in this state.
3,1,0,I'll ask for the death penalty, commuted to time served
3,1,0,That's not exactly what 'hung jury' means, but I still think it's our best chance.
3,0,0,I have to tell you, this is the first case I've had in which the plaintiff has demanded that a perfectly healthy person be removed from life support.
4,0,0,When I said dress so the jury relates to your middle age life crisis this is not what I had in mind.
3,1,0,Your case is looking grim, Mr. Reaper
3,1,0,I think you should let me do all the talking.
3,0,0,We don't have a ghost of a chance the evidence, is over whelming, but I will try my best.
4,0,0,Ordinarily, capital offenses don’t augur favorable outcomes
1,3,0,Don't be so grim. We're winning.
4,0,0,I still don't see how your looks will help us win.
3,0,1,It he DNA tests on the scythe were negative.
4,0,0,I think you can get a reduced sentence if you'll admit to that whole WWII thing.
4,0,0,No, you just have to wait until the next recess like everyone else.
4,0,0,Come to think of it glasses might soften your image.
3,1,0,Could you LOOK any more guilty?
2,1,1,You're going to need to come up with a better alibi for "where were you on the night that everyone in all of recorded history died?"
3,0,1,The presiding judge is pro-life.
2,2,0,We’re light on character witnesses.
3,0,0,I advise you not to take the stand
3,0,0,I tried to get you off, but they're insisting the death penalty.
3,1,0,I cannot advise "I had to see a man about a dog" as your best defense.
2,1,1,You should have gone with the grey suit and blue tie.
4,0,0,If we're lucky, we'll keep you from yourself.
3,1,0,The evidence is merely circumstantial, there's no "smoking sickle"!
4,0,0,I know you want a hung jury but they've got you on tax evasion!
3,0,1,I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but was Elvis really on the toilet when you got there?
3,0,0,No one's going to judge you for wearing a hoodie!
3,1,0,I have bad news. The death penalty's off the table.
4,0,0,The court will go lighter on you if you plead guilty to operating an ESCORT SERVICE instead of claiming to be the HARBINGER OF DEATH.
2,1,0,Don't worry. You're going to kill in the cross examination.
2,0,2,Remember: she was dead when you got there.
3,0,0,Wouldn't worry. You were just the messenger.
2,2,0,Just so you know, that getup is not helping your case.
1,2,0,You definitely won't get life.
3,0,0,You understand that this whole "Witness Protection" is not reversible, right?
4,0,0,Umm… Grim Reaper I'm not the right guy you're looking for. You see there's more men out there that are cheaper and I doubt you'll want me. Plus my girl always tells me I'm not a keeper, I think you'd probably want to see her, she's more of a weeper.
3,1,0,You don't think we can actually win, do you?
4,0,0,Let's try for a technicality.
1,0,1,Yes, it's called a 'wrongful death' suit, but don't take that personally.
3,0,0,But , you've already received your sentence.
2,1,0,You should drop the hoodie. It will make you look less grim.
3,1,0,unfortunately, our efforts to suppress your Yelp rating has been overruled
3,1,0,It's going to look like you don't want to face your accuser!
4,0,0,Remember what we talked about. Try to be a little less grim.
3,0,1,I thought we talked about wearing a hoodie to court...
3,0,0,Ok, but I don't know they'll agree to a death penalty plea deal.
4,0,0,Excuse me but this is the first time I represented death as a client.
3,1,0,I'm not saying to dress uncomfortably, I'm just saying hoodies are a bit fraught these days.
4,0,0,I think the jury would buy that you lost your head.
2,1,1,Your wife will drop all charges if you continue to have no contact with her.
3,1,0,The prosecutor is arguing for the death penalty on this case, although I guess that works in your favor.
3,0,0,I recommend we show them the death penalty.
1,3,0,Any chance you can remove the hoodie?
2,2,0,Look on the bright side; the death penalty is probably out.
2,1,0,Everything's going to be alright. Your execution is beyond human ability.
3,0,0,the judge insists that we habeas him a corpus.
2,1,0,.... well, then again, you may be too easy to identify.
4,0,0,Don't worry about it. They can't even spell "scythe".
4,0,0,We have a witness who can identify you from an old photo.
4,0,0,Due to the grizzly discovery of the hung jury, we motion for mistrial.
3,1,0,It's probate court. Your here as the "executor" not the "executioner".
2,1,1,"Well...yes, the death penalty is on the table, but as your lawyer, I'd advise against that!
2,2,0,You might get life.
4,0,0,Inevitability and taxes are not the best legal strategy.
2,2,0,No, you don't get off if the judge dies.
2,1,0,How does the death penalty sit with you?
2,2,0,They can prove you're responsible for multiple deaths.
3,1,0,All I'm saying is that the eyewitness identification would be much less persuasive if you had worn a suit and tie like I asked.
4,0,0,Who's calling who an empty suit?
4,0,0,All in all, your chances are pretty good...considering they didn't find a sicle.
1,2,1,The death penalty is the least of your worries.
3,0,1,Well, since there's only one of you, a jury of your peers turned out to be 12 tax lawyers.
1,2,0,You're killing me here.
3,1,0,I should tell you, the judge is not happy about those 100 billion dead bodies.
3,1,0,Potter's going to testify. You'd better take the deal.
4,0,0,I'm glad you left the scythe at home today.
2,1,1,This is your first offense, right?
2,1,0,No, the irony does not escape me.
2,2,0,Well at least the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,I'm afraid you're going to get the Death penalty.
4,0,0,Best case scenario; you'll get life.
4,0,0,My scythe couldn't get through security.
2,2,0,Remember to look each juror right in the eye.
3,1,0,I can get you eternity, with 10 years off for good behavior.
2,2,0,No, I don't know why they call it a penalty.
2,2,0,When you take the stand, don't say, "He had it coming."
3,1,0,Damn. It's Prima facie. Death and taxes.
3,1,0,It seems counter-intuitive but a death sentence is not actually in your favor.
3,0,1,Court's split 4-4. You don't look surprised.
3,1,0,I'm not worried if YOU get the death penalty.
4,0,0,There's precedent here. The judge has a heart murmur.
3,1,0,It's a little late for that now, but I get mine from Jos. A. Banks.
3,1,0,If you get life, you can walk.
2,2,0,The best we can hope for is life.
1,3,0,I don't think the preexisting condition defense is gonna fly.
3,0,0,We're going to kill this.
2,2,0,Just remember, you were home with your mother watching Judge Judy.
4,0,0,I think if we can get the scythe thrown out we have a chance
2,1,0,''You were identified by the security camera's face recognition.''
4,0,0,I wouldn't make any holiday plans.
4,0,0,"I understand you run a shell company in Panama.
2,2,0,But really, would the death sentence be so bad?
4,0,0,I have a sure-fire closing argument that has worked in even tougher cases than this: If the glove don't fit … .
3,0,0,What do you mean, there's no escape?
3,0,0,Okay so you can go lethal injection or your scythe?
3,1,0,I don't know, I've never asked for the death sentence before.
2,1,1,So I'm guessing you're not the guy from the Innocence Project?
3,1,0,I asked you to not wear the hoodie.
2,0,0,Judge: The scythe is inadmissible. Lawyer to Death: We got this in the bag. Death to Judge: I'll need that back.
4,0,0,I'm with the I.R.S. And you are...?
4,0,0,No, Mr. Reaper, 'till death us do part' is not considered plea bargaining.
2,2,0,I don't think you're giving off the best first impression.
2,1,0,I'd put you on the stand but the jury will see right through you.
4,0,0,Would it kill you to at least pretend to feel remorseful?
4,0,0,Don't worry, it's traffic court. The jury will be on your side.
4,0,0,The good news is they're requesting the death penalty.
3,1,0,'The good news is that, so far, no one can positively identify you".
3,1,0,Don't be empty headed. Take the settlement!
1,1,2,The worst you can get is life.
2,1,1,I gather this could end in the death sentence.
3,0,1,I've talked them down to 100 billion consecutive life sentences. Take the deal.
3,1,0,Sorry, this crime doesn't qualify for a death sentence.
4,0,0,What do you care how I dress, I'm doing the case pro bono!
4,0,0,Trust me. This fifth has nothing to do with the circle.
2,2,0,It's the state that asks for the death penalty, not the defense.
3,0,0,I assumed you didn't have fingerprints.
4,0,0,I'll ask for an adjournment, take a holiday.
3,1,0,No, I already told you. I couldn't find any character witnesses.
4,0,0,We'll have a better chance if you lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,It's all good. Ted Cruz is going to come in and sit next to you so you won't look so creepy.
3,0,0,Let me be clear about this...even if I lose this case, I still retain possession of my soul
4,0,0,On the other hand, 'taking the fifth' is what got you here in the first place.
3,1,0,Here comes the jury. Try not to look so grim.
3,1,0,things are looking a little grim. that's not good in this case.
4,0,0,Just don't get any penalties.
4,0,0,Maybe it was a better idea to pick up dry cleaning first.
3,1,0,A concrete metaphor comes to mind....
4,0,0,Traditionally, you don't show up until after the governor denies clemency.
4,0,0,Always wear a shirt and tie in the courtroom. The hoodie could bias the jury.
3,1,0,Will the jury be confused when they learn I'm the defendant?
3,1,0,Listen Mr. Reaper. I think it's best that we continue to refer to you by your middle name.
3,0,1,just smile and look innocent
2,0,2,Don't worry, this is clearly double jeopardy. You can't be both the defendant and the penalty.
4,0,0,He's dead to me.
3,0,1,How about, "If the hood fits, you must acquit."
4,0,0,Ok, I got them to take the You Penalty off the table.
4,0,0,Whew...I can't wait for this week to be over...
4,0,0,Keep your mouth shut, that hood up and let me do the talking
2,2,0,When I get close to you, I can hear the ocean.
2,2,0,He's suing you for unlawful termination.
3,0,1,If you don't show remorse, we can still get you the death penalty.
3,0,1,"Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six? The irony is devastating.
4,0,0,I say we ask for the death sentence, with time off for good behavior.
3,1,0,The restraining order is for stalking.
3,0,0,Oh, stop worrying about the hoodie. You're not the Black Death.
4,0,0,Remember now, "repossessing," "repossessing," not "Reaping."
3,0,0,Don't forget...smile at the jury!
2,1,0,The verdict is looking a little grim.
3,1,0,The hoodie's not working for us.
2,1,0,Would you please clarify the death clause.
3,1,0,It's only some basic legal advice but I would not offer you are here to escort them to hell. Oh, and maybe lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Worst case: You get the death penalty. Which you can live with, right?
2,2,0,You're looking at five to eternity.
4,0,0,They're offering manslaughter, and I think you should seriously consider it.
2,2,0,You'll either get a life sentence or the death penalty. So it's a win-win.
3,1,0,The coat and tie didn't work for you?
4,0,0,It's looking like afterlife in prison.
4,0,0,Yes, Community Service, but...
2,1,1,Try to look a little less mortified.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed on khakis and a nice button down shirt?
4,0,0,I think I love you, Harvey.
3,0,0,Why the long face---we're winning, aren't we?
3,1,0,This should be quick. I filed for a habeas corpus.
3,0,0,Don't worry Senor. Now that you are a client of Mossack Fonseca Wealth Management you can focus on your day job and we'll take care of your tax affairs.
4,0,0,What do you mean you left the scythe in the taxi?
3,1,0,I'm also a tax attorney
3,1,0,Can you persuade the jury with your body language?
3,1,0,The healthcare tax is coming down hard on diners.
4,0,0,Off with your head? Sorry, no, it won't be that kind of verdict.
1,3,0,Just remember, you're the defense.
4,0,0,Remember Grim ... you were the first to patent the scythe. This farmer has no case.
3,0,0,Scythes are definitely offensive weapons and the judge is not a, 'most excellent dude!'
2,1,0,Remember, you don't even know what a scythe looks like.
3,1,0,I'm gonna put you on the stand. Can you smile?
4,0,0,Yes, I suppose the fact that all the possible witnesses are dead could be considered a good thing.
3,1,0,"So you
3,1,0,So you want our plea bargain to be that you'll accept a death sentence?
3,1,0,Are you seriously asking me if you're going to get the death sentence?
1,2,1,"It's my job" is not a valid defense.
4,0,0,I don't think the judge wants to play chess with you.
3,1,0,Cross your fingers, I think I can get you the death penalty.
3,0,0,So you think our case is dead?
3,1,0,Pardon my asking, but aren't you sitting at the wrong table?
4,0,0,Sorry to waste your time but we decided to go for Life without parole.
3,1,0,You needn't ring your death knell every time I say "I object".
1,2,0,You can kill me, but I can audit you.
4,0,0,Don't worry, we can appeal his death penalty verdict.
4,0,0,You should know better than anyone that when you don't pay your taxes, this sort of thing becomes inevitable.
4,0,0,Don't worry, they're going to give you life.
4,0,0,Be not proud. It won't play with a jury.
4,0,0,Don't be worried. We have her prior statement that you kindly stopped for her.
4,0,0,Seeing as how this is a wrongful death case, I thought that perhaps I should give the closing argument this time..
4,0,0,I did suggest that wearing a suit would make you look less guilty to the jury.
4,0,0,Remember, it's not a hoodie, it's an expression of your religious freedom.
4,0,0,Trust me. I've been watching the O.J. tv trial!
4,0,0,For our next court appearance, please make yourself more presentable
4,0,0,Do you think it’s a good idea to wear a hood Mr. Simpson?
4,0,0,Of course, for you death isn't a penalty.
4,0,0,testing testing testing
3,1,0,Here comes the jury. Put on your best face.
4,0,0,That guy behind you is kinda making me nervous.
4,0,0,It's a clear case of mistaken identity. The prosecution allege their client was assaulted by nine men seeking his "precious".
3,1,0,Our problem is the jury will find it hard to sympathize with you.
4,0,0,Drop the hood and the "Doctor X" moniker, 'kay?
3,0,1,Remember, you lost your head in a moment of passion.
4,0,0,I'm fairly certain that you'll not get life.
4,0,0,I've got to warn you... hoodies don't usually go over well here.
3,1,0,We're going to have to call your mother.
3,0,0,Okay, so it’s your sincerely held religious belief that your wife should not get the ’65 Mustang convertible, the time-share in Vegas and your 401K. Anything else?
4,0,0,The good news is they aren't asking for the death penalty...
3,0,0,With any luck you will get the death penalty
1,3,0,Actually, a habeas corpus motion just might work.
4,0,0,Whatever you say, remember to keep it con-scythe.
4,0,0,I recommend that you plead guilty and demand the death penalty.
2,1,1,No, that penalty was not named just for you.
4,0,0,Please wait, system processing.
3,0,1,Nothing is certain, Death, but I think you'll have to pay your taxes.
4,0,0,I just don't know how my life could get any worse. OR I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3,0,0,Well good news bad news scenario. The good news is your not guilty.The bad news is you don't get a Life Sentence.
3,0,0,Was the shark at the dentist's?
4,0,0,...but you literally said 'I'm Death, and I am going to kill you now' and it was caught on video." "The dude's name was Herdy. You wouldn't understand.
3,1,0,I think the best option is to plead guilty and ask for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Yes, I remember specifically asking you to wear a suit.
2,1,1,Try not to laugh when they ask for the death penalty.
2,2,0,Please don't look the jurors in the eye.
3,0,0,I dunno, can you make the jury like you?
2,2,0,I can see the headline now: Death Gets Life
3,1,0,When I say "the defense rests," don't take that as an invitation.
3,1,0,I distinctly remember asking you not to wear that.
3,0,0,The thing is ... courts in this State are pro-second Amendment and 'open carry', but a sickle, that's a whole different issue.
4,0,0,We haven't discussed this yet, but I'm open to bartering when it comes to my fee.
3,1,0,If it doesn't fit, you must acquit. Right?
4,0,0,You will take " life in prison"!
4,0,0,I plea bargained from attempted murder to practicing acupuncture without a license.
4,0,0,I think we can plea bargain for the death penalty.
1,1,2,They've offered the death sentence if you'll plead guilty. It's a win win.
4,0,0,Ironic. Noooo, really? I get it, genius.
3,1,0,Are you sure you wouldn't rather just pay those parking tickets?
3,0,1,Just keep that sweet, innocent look.
4,0,0,No, I don't think an alternate juror would help.
4,0,0,Interesting idea, but it's not the way plea bargains usually work
2,2,0,Professional attire meant a suit and tie.
4,0,0,"I was only doing my job" is not a defense.
3,0,1,It wouldn't have killed you to put on a coat and tie.
4,0,0,You're only death's maître d'? Clever, but I don't think the jury will see it that way.
4,0,0,Is life-without-parole really an option for you?
3,1,0,You don't exactly have an innocent face
3,1,0,You really want the death penalty?
3,0,0,Seriously? You couldn't have worn something a little less obvious?
3,1,0,Why are you giving me a blank look? Don't you understand the charges?
3,1,0,You were expecting a change of venue...to WHERE?
4,0,0,I know you want to testify, but as your lawyer I advise against it.
4,0,0,"I think our best bet is to ask for life without parole".
3,0,0,No, most CEOs don't wear a hoodie to the hearing.
3,1,0,"I was just following orders" is not going to work for you.
3,1,0,Can't they call you by your first name, Angel? Always with the "Mr. Of Death."
2,1,0,You don't give away a damn thing, do you?
3,1,0,Remember, the prior Remember the ten billion prior deaths can't be admitted in this case
2,1,0,It doesn't really matter, right?
4,0,0,Let's skip the race card and play the death card instead.
3,0,1,Yes, but there's a difference between looking serious and looking grim.
2,1,1,Listen buddy, I don't need my soul back. I expect my hourly rate in cash.
3,0,1,They'll settle for another 10 years.
4,0,0,No, you cannot speak in your own defense.
4,0,0,Excuse me your honor. My client just lost his head for a moment.
1,2,1,Population control is not a defense.
3,0,1,Well, we can't very well go for life without parole.
2,1,0,Just stare at the judge and we'll be fine.
2,2,0,Listen Grim, I'm the king of Trademark law and I say you invented the hoodie.
4,0,0,It doesn't send a good message to the jury that you're embarrassed to be my lawyer.
3,1,0,Avoid saying "dead right" and "dead wrong" when you are on the stand.
2,1,1,You had to wear the hoodie.
1,3,0,I thought I told you no hoodie.
4,0,0,I guess you know the drill. When he asks 'The Question', take the Fifth.
4,0,0,I think I can get the murder charges dropped down to aiding and abetting.
4,0,0,I believe you but will they?
3,0,0,your attire was spot on for the Jury verdict
3,1,0,No actually, I didn't quite understand your last voicemail message. It didn't make much sense - something about a bell and tolls?!?
2,1,0,You don't get a jury of your exact peers.
4,0,0,If we enter a guilty plea and ask for the death penalty, what have you got to lose?
4,0,0,Remember, you were just a bookkeeper, and occasionally helped on collections.
4,0,0,As your lawyer I have to know: did you mean to kill them?
2,1,1,The best we can hope for is a hung jury.
4,0,0,No, I'm afraid that won't work - they'll see right through you.
3,1,0,I'm sure you'll appreciate the irony of 'life in prison.'
4,0,0,You know I get paid on and hourly basis
4,0,0,They only have two alternates so go a little easy on the jury pool.
3,1,0,I don't think you will get the death sentence.
3,0,0,..the judge wants to know if you "jumped the gun" a bit...
2,2,0,No, I'm sorry, you cannot execute yourself
2,0,0,It'll be a hung jury anyway.
2,1,1,Cheer up, your chances are pretty grim.
4,0,0,I'm grateful for the option, but the Trump court has yet to determine the specifics of "fate worse than death."
4,0,0,We're all requesting a continuance
3,0,1,Pretend like you're holding an invisible baseball and the gloves won't fit.
2,1,0,My bad! I thought you would have loved the death penalty.
3,1,0,Did I not specifically ask you to wear a nice blue suit?
3,0,0,Sorry. It's not that your too grim, it's the hoody...
4,0,0,What's new in the hood?
3,1,0,You might offer to play a game of chess to delay sentencing.
3,1,0,Great idea! Your defense is really going to kill them.
4,0,0,You're in luck--he's a hanging judge.
2,2,0,Next time, just let me ask the judge if we can strike the juror.
3,1,0,I need you to say you feared for your safety.
4,0,0,Must I remind you? Facial expressions are important for the jury
4,0,0,It was suicide! I had nothing to do with it!
3,1,0,Our "mistaken identity" defense seems to be working.
4,0,0,No, that's not what habeas corpus means.
2,0,1,Maybe we say it's just a hoodie.
4,0,0,When they told you we would do this "pro bono," who were you talking to?
3,1,0,You're looking at life.
4,0,0,your community service has been taken into consideration.
3,1,0,There's not much we can do. You were clocked going 90.
3,1,0,I guess you don't have a problem with the Death Penalty here.
2,2,0,Don't worry, this state still has the death penalty.
2,2,0,Skid marks before the skunk. Yes, yes I've heard that one too.
0,2,0,The death penalty? OK, why not?
4,0,0,They're charging you on a 100 billion counts
0,4,0,These juror absences are starting to seem suspicious.
3,1,0,I'm sorry. They've sentenced you to life.
4,0,0,Not good. The jury thinks you're a hoodie.
3,1,0,It would really help if you could think of at least one favorable character witness.
3,0,0,Life without parole. I wish I had better news.
2,1,0,Well, you can take the plea ... or you know kill everyone.
3,0,0,You know this whole "hoodie thing" you got going on REALLY isn't helping us out right now.
4,0,0,I hope you were one of the dead lawyers on ocean's bottom. We need a good start here.
1,1,1,The Bible catching fire didn't help.
3,0,0,Remember you asked if there were lawyers in the afterlife and got mad when I said I couldn’t tell you? Well good news…next Wednesday you will find out…
4,0,0,No, I'm sorry, we needed an execu-TOR.
3,0,1,not a good time to announce you support the death penalty
1,2,0,They call me the Grim Briefer.
3,1,0,Income tax evasion? Really?
3,0,1,Look at the bright side, how bad could the death penalty be?
2,1,0,We could use the death penalty as a loop hole.
4,0,0,If we lose it will be deja vu.
4,0,0,Yes, I'm certain we've made a good case against the death tax.
0,3,1,Remember, you were only the ferryman.
3,1,0,Sure the hoodie hides your hair well enough, but the name Trump carries a lot of baggage these days.
2,2,0,We're getting some push back on work release.
3,1,0,I've told you: there's no capital crime in divorce court
3,1,0,After this, are you going to take a holiday?
3,0,0,La muerte on trial for planning the end of the world.
3,0,0,I told you not to show up in your work clothes.
2,1,1,Was it the hoodie?
4,0,0,Plead Nolo.
2,1,1,Unfortunately they just found the Scythe.
3,0,0,We need a better angle than you thought you were exempt from paying taxes.
1,2,1,You do the final argument.
3,1,0,I asked you not to dress like the judge.
3,1,0,you'd have to admit, these cases are becoming more grim
3,0,0,as your lawyer I have to tell you that your outlook is very Grimm
2,1,1,But wouldn't taking the judges soul just prove their case?
3,0,1,When you said underworld, I thought you meant mob related.
3,1,0,How about twenty to life?
3,0,0,It's going to be hard to find an unbiased jury.
4,0,0,I know there is nothing certain except death and taxes so please let me finish.
4,0,0,So you're taking the fifth?
3,0,0,I told you to dress for court!
2,2,0,You're sure you want to plead not guilty"?
3,1,0,At least you'll have your own row.
3,1,0,Our defense will be the law's religious exemption.
3,0,0,It's a death penalty case. There is no statute of limitations.
1,2,1,Don't worry - nobody cheats Death.
4,0,0,Okay great news: if you plea, the prosecutor has agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,You're screwed", "everybody hates you.
4,0,0,Frankly speaking, GR, we don't stand a ghost of a chance.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but the death penalty was abolished here in 1965.
4,0,0,Yes, 'Habeas Corpus' is Latin for "you shall have the body," but they don't mean it literally.
2,1,0,The best I can get you is life.
3,1,0,Don't look so grim Mr. Reaper.
4,0,0,Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the black cap.
3,0,0,I got this, just because you walk around with a hoody doesn't make you a criminal.
4,0,0,You of all people should appreciate the certainty of taxes.
2,1,0,Lucky for you, it's a hung jury.
3,1,0,You're telling me you're against the death penalty?
1,3,0,Dress different tomorrow.
3,1,0,The Judge is willing to make a deal.
2,1,1,You're right again -- another 12 more jurors suddenly died.
4,0,0,This case is a real killer
4,0,0,Yes, yes, I adore Dickens too, but we're not here to argue it's his masterpiece.
2,1,0,You're up. Look alive.
4,0,0,Let's just say it looks suspicious when their witnesses keep dying.
4,0,0,There's no way I'm putting you on the stand.
4,0,0,We're gonna plead life, without parole.
4,0,0,Just remember: you're a cowl. You've never been a hood.
2,1,0,You ok with life, without parole?
3,0,1,Although you usually command respect, Senate committees talk over everyone.
2,0,2,It's not looking good, Mr. Cheney.
3,1,0,Take the plea. Otherwise, you're facing the You penalty.
3,0,1,They know they can't touch me.
4,0,0,I wouldn't recommend an ex post facto defense. You don't want to open yourself up to biblical punishment.
4,0,0,perhaps it would be better if you didn't make eye contact with the jury
3,0,1,Remember, you've never owned a scythe.
4,0,0,Well at least you won't have to worry about getting the death penalty.
4,0,0,Don't worry. If they don't dismiss the class-action after these hearings, we're simply going to ask for some class members to appear in person.
3,1,0,In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except taxes.
3,1,0,Getting life is not something to be happy about.
3,0,0,Leave the Death Penalty on the table, then.
4,0,0,I must warn you. Juries never find disappearing acts convincing,
0,4,0,I just want to confirm - You only came to me because you need a lawyer.
4,0,0,Good news: you got the death penalty
1,1,0,I told you not to face the jury.
4,0,0,H.R.3355
3,1,0,Smart to ditch the scythe before court, but you'll still do time with that hoodie.
3,0,1,If you lose the hood we might be able to get a conviction on the haircut.
2,0,2,They're blaming you for the hung jury too.
3,1,0,I don't think your testimony will help my client avoid the death penalty!
3,1,0,Enough with the dead lawyer jokes.
2,2,0,I'm sorry, but "its my thing" is not a defense.
3,1,0,Relax… a death sentence gets your released on your own recognizance.
3,1,0,I just don't see how we can argue it was an act of god.
2,1,0,Of course I said "coat and tie" and not "cloak and scythe."
4,0,0,Im not sure how to tell you this.... but they gave you death.
4,0,0,They want to give you a life sentence but I might be able to plea bargain a death sentence.
2,2,0,I have to warn you, this could become pretty grim.
3,0,0,She's firm on the pet groomer.
4,0,0,Not your actual work suit - a suit you would wear to work.
4,0,0,The good news is we don't have to worry about the death penalty.
3,1,0,Alright, so I'm doing this pro bono, but don't forget our deal. When I die, I get to go out banging some hot chick, like the president did in "Dave."
4,0,0,I don't think you can take the soul of the court. It doesn't have one.
3,0,1,In witness protection people won't recognize you.
4,0,0,Donald, listen to me, trust me, the Grim Reaper look is a classy step up.
3,0,0,I think the jury can see right through your argument.
2,2,0,Remember, if they ask about the Black Plague, plead the Fifth.
4,0,0,This judge is reasonable. I think we can plea bargain the charges from 110 billion counts down to 80 billion or so...
3,1,0,I guess a tax case was inevitable.
3,1,0,We're losing pretty badly so far. Can you...you know...'visit' a couple of the jurors?
2,2,0,Would it have killed you to wear a tie?
4,0,0,Don't be alarmed, you could get life.
2,1,0,If you take the stand, they may only see a hood.
2,2,0,A guilty verdict won't be a problem for you.
4,0,0,From here on, I hope you'll dress more appropriately for court.
3,1,0,Didn't I tell you to wear a suit and tie?
1,1,1,Try to show some remorse ….
4,0,0,If the trial goes as planned, I should be able to get you the death penalty.
4,0,0,Sorry sir, we strive to appear transparent here
4,0,0,Be not proud—you need to look more sympathetic.
2,0,1,We're going with the empty suit defense.
3,1,0,I told you, no hoodies in court.
2,1,1,I'd suggest you lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Are you kidding me? It was your evil twin. THAT'S your defense?
3,1,0,Get rid of the hoodie. It makes you look guilty.
2,2,0,I can't guarantee you life.
3,1,0,You're not the empty suit I was expecting.
4,0,0,They want to charge for murder, but I think we can find a way around that.
1,2,0,I'm assuming that you'll be fine with the death penalty.
3,1,0,I said a business suit AND a tie.
0,4,0,As you might expect, the outlook is pretty grim.
4,0,0,Now, let me get this straight ... you prefer to settle out of court and bargain with the devil?
2,2,0,Trust me. It's called the metaphor defense.
3,1,0,The criminal justice system doesn't like black hoodies.
3,0,0,I'll do my best, but 187 trillion counts of murder is going to be tough.
2,2,0,You better let me do the talking.
2,2,0,No, you cannot plead "taking a holiday."
2,2,0,Unfortunately, it's death AND taxes.
4,0,0,Recidivism? He’s saying you’re a repeat offender, and the court will take that into consideration when sentencing.
3,0,1,I'm actually just entering this to test something on the site sorry Colin
4,0,0,You may prejudice the jury
4,0,0,For the last time, you're not pleading the "scythe"!
2,1,1,All we have to do is establish reasonable doubt. Please stop looking at the jury.
3,1,0,Yes, they believe you. That's the problem.
3,1,0,I can get the death penalty off the table but your going to have to stand .
3,1,0,No, you can't request the death penalty just to 'get out of here'.
3,1,0,Just how long have you been waiting for a Public Defender to get to your case?
4,0,0,Trust me. You're dead. This double indemnity defense is gonna work.
3,1,0,We actually GO for the death penalty--then double jeopardy on appeal. Agreed?
2,2,0,Grim, is what I would consider your chances of successfully arguing against the death penalty Mr. Reaper.
2,2,0,Can you repeat that? This time, without the echo............
4,0,0,I'd like a motion request.
4,0,0,Our brief: the death penalty is 'cruel and unusual punishment.'
4,0,0,The worst they can give you is life.
2,1,1,Your best defense is that you are a myth.
4,0,0,You promised the next time we're called in front of the Senate, I could wear it!
4,0,0,Relax. Without the scythe, they haven't got a prayer.
3,1,0,I told you it would be impossible to get a cancer patent.
2,1,1,The hung jury joke might have been a bad call.
4,0,0,Any one that says you're guilty has a hole in his head!
2,1,0,Don't worry. The preponderance of evidence will prove the defendant lost that chess game to you.
3,1,0,Just tell them the Devil made you do it
3,1,0,it's not looking good...
3,1,0,Maybe you could kill less people.
4,0,0,No, we can not ask for the death penalty, you were arrested for trespassing.
4,0,0,In your case, a hung jury is likely
4,0,0,You sure you want to plead the sith?
3,1,0,Just a reminder, the death penalty is on the table.
4,0,0,I don't think self-defense is the way to go.
1,3,0,I'll insist they strike every reference to "grim" as prejudicial.
1,1,2,Yes, but Johnnie Cochran's not around any more. And whose fault is that?
4,0,0,My best advice: deny everything.
3,0,1,I'm sure we can get it bumped down to three trillion counts of murder instead of five.
2,0,1,Remember, I'll do all the talking.
4,0,0,Soon you will be free to show your face.
0,2,1,I'm thinking the death penalty would be win-win.
4,0,0,I think our best shot here is to plead guilty.
2,2,0,Any chance juror #6 won't still be with us by the end of the trial?
3,0,0,Now, remember to keep your poker-face when you sit up there.
3,0,0,Your alibi is good.
4,0,0,At least the Guillotine should be off the table.
2,1,0,I'm a huge fan of your early work.
4,0,0,This could take a while.
2,2,0,Maybe we should stop insisting on a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,The judge asked if this is your first offense.
3,1,0,I want to win one of these before I die.
2,1,0,Hey man, If you had just paid your taxes, we wouldn't be here.....
3,1,0,I really don't think they'll believe you're a monk.
3,1,0,Of course your fingerprints weren't found, but the dead body isn't going to help you either.
2,1,1,It appears to be a hung jury.
2,2,0,I'm sorry, but you don't have a snowball's chance in hell.
3,1,0,It doesn't look good, I'm going to need payment up front.
3,0,1,Well, it's "death penalty" with a lower-case "d" so your brand is still safe.
3,1,0,I understand your excitement, but this is not Texas.
1,1,1,No laughing when they give you life.
4,0,0,But he said he would replace the Constitution with 'something terrific.'
3,1,0,Where's the jury?
4,0,0,Judge, I assure you he did not mean to kill that innocent girl. It's just the nature of him to do such things.
3,1,0,Honestly, your only chance of getting off these charges is winning an election to public office
3,1,0,Try to look remorseful.
3,1,0,Our case looks grim.
3,0,1,I know, I know. I'm annoyed it's called a penalty, too.
2,2,0,I still do not understand why this has become a capital case.
2,2,0,You've an appointment with me?
4,0,0,No offense... At least it's not the death penalty
2,2,0,You know, this time, it's not your place to judge.
4,0,0,I promise you, if you just say what I tell you, you won't lose face
3,0,0,win or lose , it's how you wore your hat
4,0,0,No sir, we cannot appeal. The judge ruled that the statute of limitations applies in your case since it was proved you died in 1893.
3,1,0,Are you stalking me?
2,1,0,This doesn't look good.
4,0,0,Any sentence will be an death sentence.
2,1,0,Sorry, you've got to lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,I don't think an appointment in Samarra works as an alibi.
3,0,0,If you're lucky, you'll get life.
3,0,1,Don't worry, I think you'll get life.
2,1,0,Your attire might be a little grim.
2,1,1,So, your plea is justifiable homicide?
3,1,0,Residuals -including international- we aren't settling for less.
4,0,0,There's a little problem with your character witnesses. They're all dead.
3,0,0,As your tax attorney, I hope to subtract one item from that so called two-things-for-certain list.
1,2,1,No, I won't say "The defense rests in peace."
3,1,0,Bragging about your career isn't helping.
3,1,0,You broke the law when you touched them.
3,1,0,What's your definition of habeas corpus?
3,0,0,No, the bailiff won't bring you your scythe.
3,0,1,I would take the life sentence if I were you.
4,0,0,Whatever the verdict, know that I'm honored to have represented the most prolific serial killer of all time.
4,0,0,We're basing our defense on hoodie prejudice, OK?
3,1,0,They've decided to take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,I think you need to say more than, ' I was just doing my job.'
3,1,0,OK, no scythe is good, but I told you to wear a suit and tie.
3,0,1,Yeah but it turns out taxes are more sure.
4,0,0,Don't be alarmed. I was sent here to kill the bill.
4,0,0,No, the optics are not on our side.
3,1,0,...it may be too late for a cover up or face saving measures .
2,0,0,Yeah, just like that – keep staring at the jury.
3,0,1,With any luck, we'll get you life.
4,0,0,Yes Grim, you have a Constitutional Right to testify, however I still urge you not to do so.
4,0,0,I know they say nothing is certain but you and taxes, but they're demanding hard evidence.
2,0,1,When you're up on the stand, try not to look like you're dead.
3,0,0,Sorry, but the jury isn't literally hung.
4,0,0,I worked hard to keep the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,I admire that you're now pro-life. This doesn't, however, preclude you from doing your job. Your discrimination suit just won't stick.
2,0,1,No. Look, it's a civil case--he doesn't get the death penalty if you win.
3,1,0,I'd say not to worry, because this is Texas and they need you, but on the other hand, this IS Texas.
3,0,0,What do you mean, not guilty!? I thought I was being sentenced to life!
3,1,0,This is not going to be easy.
4,0,0,I think I can get the charge reduced to involuntary manslaughter.
3,0,1,I'm going to try and get the death penalty off the table.
1,3,0,Take my advice and don't smile at any of the jurors.
3,0,1,We're going to go with the death sentence.
1,3,0,I asked you not to wear your hoodie to court.
3,0,1,You're late, and Taxes had to testify with minimal preparation. Everyone in the defendant's shoes usually gets a life sentence, but now I'm not so certain.
4,0,0,'I'm entering a guilty plea,the Scythe had your DNA all over it."
3,1,0,Remember Mr. Reaper, you went to the movies alone on the night of January 9th.
3,1,0,Apparently, the 'open carry' law doesn't apply to scythes.
4,0,0,I'm going to move for summary judgment.
4,0,0,Plea bargain? I don't think so.
4,0,0,Don't worry, a guy like you will kill it in prison.
4,0,0,Nope, this is the Grim Sleeper trial.
4,0,0,Forgive the irony, but you should have filed years ago.
4,0,0,Is this about your mother again?
3,0,0,If it's life, I'm going for cruel and unusual punishment.
3,0,0,The "Grim Reaper" defense scythes both ways !
3,0,1,Cheer up, I think we can get it reduced to manslaughter.
2,2,0,This is my first death case.
1,2,1,You might have a chance. All your witnesses are dead.
4,0,0,Plead the insanity defense: it's the best way to beat the serial unauthorized abduction charge.
3,0,1,The jury's hung.
3,0,1,We don't recommend the death penalty for shoplifting
3,1,0,All things considered, LIFE without parole is pretty generous.
4,0,0,Yes, it does look different from this side of the table Mr. Scalia.
4,0,0,Let's bluff 'em, and leave the 'death sentence' on the table.
3,0,0,nope, no pre-cradle, no post-grave...
4,0,0,He's sentencing you to life
3,1,0,No problem -- the death penalty is automatic in this case.
3,1,0,It will help your defense if we refer to you as something other than the Grim Reaper.
3,1,0,Just don't laugh when they talk about the death penalty.
2,2,0,Keep it out of sight unless one of their witnesses starts lying.
4,0,0,I don't think killing all the jury members is a good idea.
3,1,0,It's a little bizarre, but it may help convince the jury that you were a victim of identity theft.
4,0,0,I think I can get you a life sentence.
4,0,0,I don’t think “He lost the game of chess” is much of a defense
3,1,0,Slowing overpopulation is a weak defense, but it's all we got.
2,0,2,If we win don't hug me.
4,0,0,They're trying to paint your intent as especially grim.
4,0,0,Time to reap what you sow.
3,1,0,Life sounds pretty good, don't you think?
3,1,0,Whatever you do, don't look at the jury.
2,1,1,Any way you can lose the hoodie?
3,1,0,I wouldn't use that alibi.
4,0,0,We have to find a glove that doesn't fit you.
2,1,0,And remember, saying "the devil made me do it" probably won't sit well with the jury.
2,1,0,No expression is not a suitable substitute for a first impression
3,1,0,I don't think taking the fifth is going to do it.
3,0,1,So, ummm, how do you feel about the death penalty? I would advise you to refrain from calling the death penalty, simply another day at the office.
2,0,0,They'll be going for the death penalty so, eh, no worries.
3,0,0,Don't you think it might be better to throw yourself on the mercy of the court?
3,1,0,Remember to give the jury your killer smile.
3,1,0,I have to be honest, there's a very good chance you could get the dea... the you penalty.
4,0,0,I get you the death penalty and you're complaining?
3,0,0,We can appeal, but I don't think a different judge will grant you the death penalty.
2,1,0,I told you to get a new suit !
1,2,1,Let's lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but you are not allowed to plead the fifth commandment.
3,1,0,Ironic. They're seeking the death penalty.
3,1,0,Bad news, looks like your getting life...
3,1,0,Are you sure you want to seek a life sentence?
4,0,0,I don't know if the death penalty applies in your case.
4,0,0,It means, 'Show me the body.'
3,0,0,Keep a straight face.
3,0,0,The judge isn't budging. No sickles in the courtroom.
2,0,1,I WANT A DIFFERENT LAWYER.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, you have to face the facts.
2,0,0,Have you got a nice suit? This is a tough jury.
1,2,1,Without the scythe, they got nothing.
2,1,1,Best not to mention that whole, "Black Plague" thing.
4,0,0,Would you consider wearing a tie?
2,0,1,No. Even if you plead guilty, they can't give you life.
2,2,0,How do you even get ticketed on the Highway to Hell?
4,0,0,Look at the bright side, you might get life.
2,0,1,''She claims you were a big facetime fan.''
3,0,1,Remember you didn't do a thing. You were just the welcome committee.
3,0,1,If the scythe don't fit, you must acquit!
4,0,0,well this is my report on the argument of TTIP in which the US intends to enslave the entire world to corporate US businesses which will eventually lead to the WW3 and the end of the human race and your folder is the argument for it
2,1,1,I think 'It's my job' won't work as a line of defense here.
4,0,0,Remember, we have to let the jury see the real you.
3,1,0,No, no... the other kind of habeas corpus.
4,0,0,The judge has decided to move the trial away from Sleepy Hollow....
1,2,1,Fine, but let me handle the jury selection.
2,1,1,Her attorney wants your soul too.
2,0,2,Death AND taxes, death AND taxes. Why is that so hard for you to get?
3,0,1,Your win would be my loss.
4,0,0,Would you like to flip a coin to decide your fate, Jerry?
2,2,0,You're early--the penalty phase comes after the verdict."
4,0,0,You do realize that you're on trial for a capital offense?
4,0,0,Something tells me he won't be sentenced to life.
2,0,1,They're going to push for the you sentence.
4,0,0,You are the Grim Reaper." "Well this time, I'm innocent, so prove it, or you will be my next victim.
3,0,1,Ok i admit when the marriage vow said 'Til Death Us Do Part' i didn't think i would be paying you $300 an hour to make it happen!
2,0,2,I believe that your courtroom attire is not helping our case.
4,0,0,Are you worried you will be or won't be sentenced to death?!
3,0,0,We can’t lose. What jury is going to risk pissing off Death?
1,2,0,Actually, I've never had a client sentence the judge to death before.
4,0,0,I'm not so confident the jury will buy our not guilty plea with the whole "death personified" look you've got going on today.
3,1,0,I’ll do this pro bono if you do me a little favor …
4,0,0,Yes, as the plaintiff in an identity theft case, you will have to testify.
4,0,0,Trust me. If Luke got away with being too short for a stromtrooper, I can convince the jury that you're a jawa.
2,1,0,"It's what you do" may not be the best defense.
3,0,1,Wear the Gap hoodie tomorrow.
3,0,0,Are you certain you paid your taxes?
2,1,1,No, I have not seen any Ingmar Bergman films.
4,0,0,Good news - the IRS lawyers agreed to a jury instruction on irony.
4,0,0,I thought I told you to dress less "hood."
2,2,0,They can't touch you.
4,0,0,Just tell the judge, you take the fifth! I live in Wisconsin
2,1,1,When I put you on the stand, just don't look at the jurors.
4,0,0,"Yes, I got it Mr. Brown - I was acting in self defense".
1,1,2,This is our last appeal, so please stop referring to your sentence the 'me penalty.'
3,1,0,Death Penalty? Really?
4,0,0,The judge wants to know why you killed those 100 billion people.
1,3,0,I want a different lawyer for the punishment phase.
3,1,0,The judge is going to ask you to face the jury, and that's when I'll declare a mistrial for discriminatory practices.
3,1,0,Your outcome is looking grim.
3,1,0,You;ve gotta stop pointing at the jurors and shouting 'You're next!"
3,0,0,Dying declaration?
2,1,1,I'll plead you down from grim reaping to simple reaping.
3,1,0,We need a better defense than “his time was up.”
4,0,0,We can negotiate a plea to avoid a life sentence.
4,0,0,I might be able to get the murder charge reduced to 'Following Too Close'.
2,2,0,I strongly advise that you leave the hood on.
1,2,1,It's tough, defending a serial killer.
4,0,0,On the upside, the death penalty's of the table. On the not so great side, you could get 25 years to eternity in Hell.
2,1,0,Has anyone seen your face?
4,0,0,Mind you, outside Texas we'd call it a misdemeanor.
4,0,0,So--you can really make these parking tickets go away?
4,0,0,You've got to stop staring at the jury like that
2,2,0,Just think of it this way, a life time career doing what you love.
3,1,0,Are you really suggesting "depraved indifference"?
3,1,0,If the judge gives you the death penalty, try not to laugh, OK?
2,2,0,The way I see it, your a deadman.
4,0,0,You should be happy the charges were reduced to manslaughter.
1,2,0,So what it's a death penalty case. What do you care?
4,0,0,I don't think 'It's my job' is a good defense.
3,1,0,Good news, it's only the death penalty.
4,0,0,Let's review the charges: manslaughter of, well, everyone.
2,1,1,Good news: the prosecution couldn't find anyone willing to testify against you.
3,1,0,Just remember- You saw nothing, you heard nothing.
3,0,0,Here's the problem. You have a really bad reputation.
4,0,0,I'm going to ask you one last time. Did you kill that man?
3,1,0,The D.A. is asking for life.
2,2,0,Can you drum up some character references?
2,1,0,You can't keep doing that to the jury!
1,3,0,Remember! The longer I live the more I can do for you!
2,1,0,Stop asking for the desk penalty, it's just a parking ticket.
3,1,0,And remember, only answer the question asked.
1,2,0,I think you misunderstood me when I said we need to bury the evidence against you,
3,1,0,Look, the most important thing is that you not lose face.
2,1,1,Your check bounced
4,0,0,Are you winking at me?
2,1,1,They want the You Penalty.
3,0,0,You're not likable enough for us to risk putting you on the stand.
3,1,0,For the umpteenth time, its YOUR life on the line, not mine.
4,0,0,You’d seem more sympathetic in a pastel cloak.
3,0,0,No, this state does not have the death penalty.
3,1,0,What's this about an appointment in Samarra?
2,0,1,The Image Consultant said we should have gone with a blue oxford.
2,2,0,But I don't understand. You said to wear my suit
1,2,1,She wants the scythe, too.
4,0,0,I heard the prosecution was scared to death.
4,0,0,Um, yes I did say wear a dark suit.
4,0,0,This is about more than just saving face.
0,3,1,It won't be easy finding a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,The deposed witnesses are reposed?
2,2,0,I'm going to ask that you pay my bill before you testify.
3,1,0,You could be looking at life.
3,1,0,I'm not sure he can do this, but the judge just gave you the death penalty.
4,0,0,What about the penalty, Death?
3,1,0,If we can convince them you're Death, they'll probably give you Life.
4,0,0,Between you and me, we can kill this case!
4,0,0,The Judge told me you are not to threaten the jury anymore.
4,0,0,I understand not afraid of capital Punishment.
2,1,0,Seriously, a life sentence is preferable to the death penalty.
3,1,0,Can I tell the jury that you are willing to commute their death sentence.
2,2,0,We could argue they were at your door.
3,1,0,Don't forget, don't smile at the jury!
1,1,1,now if you can just take care of the judge, we'll be all set
3,1,0,I'm pretty sure they're not going to let me enter an appearance as "devil's advocate," what's your second choice?
3,0,1,If they ask you anything about Scalia, you answer: "On the advice of my counsel I respectfully exercise my fifth amendment right and decline to answer that question."
4,0,0,Try not to give the jury a blank stare.
4,0,0,So, you are sticking with - ‘God is your witness’?
4,0,0,We can get a court order but I can't guarantee that the magazines will stop.
4,0,0,I'm asking the judge for the death penalty in lieu of prison time.
4,0,0,Actually, I do identify with you in a Millennial sort of way...
3,0,0,Let's face it ... never mind.
3,1,0,Not to worry, nobody will know you're in "Witness protection"
2,1,0,I don't suppose you could manage to show up in a pure-as-the-driven-snow color tomorrow?
3,0,0,Actually, in this jurisdiction, it's the judge's responsibility to issue the death sentence.
4,0,0,Maybe I should not have hired a lawyer who was in the witness-protection program.
3,0,1,They'll drop everything else, but you can't avoid the tax charge.
3,1,0,I advise you not to testify. I don't think the jury will relate well to you.
4,0,0,The death penalty is still on the table. Our only hope is a hung jury. Can you help with that?
3,0,1,The judge gave you life...but don't worry, it isn't what you think.
4,0,0,Sorry, I'm drawing a blank on your name.
1,2,1,Please stop saying "goody!" whenever they mention the death penalty.
3,0,0,The courtroom is all about theatre. So, break a leg." "If the jury looks at you, you're a free spirit." "It's hard to find a jury of your peers." "So I'm off the hook, right? A long and healthy life?
3,0,0,Hard to find a sympathetic jury.
3,0,1,No...you cant plead "Guilty by reason of being Death"
4,0,0,Great news....you are going to be sentenced to death.
4,0,0,The souls were nonexempt
1,1,2,I'm sure you'll have the last word on this.
4,0,0,it would help your case if you appeared remorseful
4,0,0,It couldn't hurt to meet with the stylist.
3,1,0,We'll just tell them you have a great track record filing habeus corpus.
2,2,0,Bad news, they found a scythe with your fingerprints on them.
3,1,0,I'll do all the talking, all I want from you is dead silence.
4,0,0,You need not have dressed up for my wrap-up.
4,0,0,Show them the upside of being dragged to the underworld.
3,0,1,How do you know the jury is hung?
4,0,0,Don't worry, I'm going to get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Claim you were unfairly profiled.
4,0,0,At this point your case looks pretty grim!
4,0,0,'We don't normally have a reputation for ambulance chasing.'
4,0,0,Next we have to make the jury like you".
3,1,0,The jury doesn't seem to like you.
3,1,0,Ditch the hoodie, just take the 5th.
4,0,0,No, I don't have any books on black magic.
2,2,0,You're lookin' at life. Which could be a good thing.
4,0,0,Showing remorse is good but in your case showing anything is a bonus.
3,0,1,I don't think you quite understand the concept Habeas Corpus...
4,0,0,Relax. Each juror will only be thinking about the net time they meet you.
4,0,0,Lucky for you we may get you off with involuntary manslaughter.
3,1,0,Would it kill you to wear a suit?
3,0,0,Your prospects are looking grim.
3,1,0,The judge wants to plead with you.
4,0,0,Don't worry, they aren't seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,Is this the subcommittee hearing on Death and Taxes?
2,2,0,And please stop telling me things are looking grim.
3,0,0,As your attorney, I can only say that your suit will just make you look more guilty.
3,1,0,Most of my clients think of it as a penalty.
1,0,2,Could I possibly ask you to use 'Your Honor' instead of 'You're next'?
2,1,0,We're going to try for a life sentence.
4,0,0,Just cross your fingers that they give you concurrent instead of consecutive sentences.
4,0,0,I just got word that Brad Pitt wants to play you in the movie.
3,0,0,Don't appeal the lethal injection. You'll still be home for dinner.
3,1,0,They are pushing for the Death Penalty
3,1,0,So this is the first time I've represented Anonymous.
4,0,0,Just once more, I'd like to see your pretty little face.
2,1,1,Sometimes I have the feeling I'm talking to myself.
4,0,0,The hoodie is only illegal if you commit a crime.
4,0,0,What did you expect, in that hoodie?
4,0,0,I know you were hoping for a hung jury, but you will have to face them.
2,1,0,I will take the 5th amendment!
2,2,0,Don t worry.The jurors will love your soft look.
4,0,0,The irony is they want to give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,Look, just try to appear upbeat. This jury looks sympathetic.
3,1,0,I thought we agreed that you wouldn't wear your hoodie to court!
2,1,1,The press is going to have a field day if the judge gives you life.
1,3,0,The good news is the prosecution will have a difficult time finding witnesses.
4,0,0,Remember to make eye contact - it's important they see you as a human being.
2,2,0,If that's your innocent look, we're doomed.
3,0,0,So I think we stay with the hood. Yes, the judge hates it, but juror number 3 keeps smiling at you.
3,1,0,So, I don't think we'll be able to get the death sentence off the table...
3,1,0,The jury wants the death penalty. That's as good as an acquittal for you!
4,0,0,There's so much evidence against you, the jury wants to give you the death penalty AGAIN!!!
3,1,0,Personally, I don't think you have a ghost of a chance.
1,2,1,Push for the death penalty.
2,0,2,I don't think they believe this was your first offense.
2,1,0,Ironically, you'll probably get life.
4,0,0,We need to get the jury on our side. Look them in the eyes.
3,1,0,This will only work if you cry when they give you the death penalty.
2,1,1,Don't worry - they can't possibly give you a life sentence.
2,1,1,I can't find any character references for you...
4,0,0,It doesn't look good but at least there's no death penalty in this state.
2,0,0,Getting a venue change to the underworld might be difficult.
4,0,0,And please don't laugh so loud when you hear the verdict!
3,1,0,Don't worry. The prosecutor is an empty suit.
4,0,0,We got this
3,1,0,What do you mean "you want to change your plea to "not guilty""?
1,2,1,I'll subtly inform the jury that you know where each of them lives.
3,0,0,You don't have to tell them where your sting is.
3,0,0,A plea of self-defense won't fly well in your case.
3,1,0,I'm so tired of these wrongful death lawsuits.
3,1,0,Let me get this straight .. I am the evil sorcerer here
1,1,1,Of course, you have the final say.
2,1,0,Don't take the deal. Life plus 80 is a heck of a lot worse than a sentence of death for you.
2,1,1,Consider yourself dead
2,1,1,Trust me, you'll look less guilty with glasses.
4,0,0,Just trying to tell the judge everything clearly
2,1,0,Lose the hoodie and their witness will never identify you.
3,1,0,Is it OK if I were to refer to you as 'my client'?
3,1,0,The prosecutor's trying to persuade the judge that the death penalty's not enough.
3,0,1,I get it, believe me, 25 to life is ironic.
4,0,0,Please stop pointing at the jurors.
2,1,0,It is, too, a jury of your peers; we're in Texas.
2,1,0,I definitely think that removing your hood will improve our case.
2,0,1,I know you are homesick, but you can't get the death penalty for speeding!
3,0,0,With any luck, the prosecutor will go for the Death penalty.
3,0,0,No, it is not a sentence that is written by you.
4,0,0,The defense wants to take you off the table.
3,1,0,You might want to lose the hoodie.
4,0,0,Look, we can plea down to misdemeanor possession of a scythe, but I can't do anything about the murder charges.
3,1,0,Yea, it will be a hung jury.
4,0,0,Government security aside, Apple might cooperate more if you were a little more transparent.
3,0,1,Does it really matter if they give you life or death?
4,0,0,Try to look earnest, but not too earnest.
1,2,0,You're probably looking at the death penalty.
3,1,0,Honestly, I don't think a reduced sentence for good behavior is in the cards.
2,1,1,And your profession is still viewed favorable to mine.
3,1,0,Trust me. Direct eye contact with the jury can work in our favor.
4,0,0,Usually the jury doesn't reach a verdict this fast. Could be good?
4,0,0,You did copyright the death penalty ?
4,0,0,I'm going to ask for habeas corpus.
4,0,0,Of course you are innocent, but I'd plead the 5th anyway.
2,2,0,Sh-h-h. 108 billion counts of homicide is nothing to snicker at.
4,0,0,But you're not qualified to BE President.
3,0,0,The judge is going to need to see that you have a mouth before permitting us to use the Twinkie defense.
3,1,0,Ixnay on the eathday talk.
2,1,1,I have to be honest, this is my first 100 billion tuple murder case.
4,0,0,No matter how many souls you've already taken-- deny, deny, deny, & plead "not guilty."
2,1,0,Life Imprisonment is intended to be a punishment, not a philosophy.
3,0,1,I'll claim you're being framed because of the hoodie.
3,1,0,Don't show too much emotion.
4,0,0,Just tell them you blacked out.
4,0,0,I thought you understood --- this is Civil Court --- there's no jury, so we can ditch the theatrics.
3,1,0,"He had it coming" just won't do....
3,1,0,They've got an eye witness.
3,0,0,You told her, "Ich komme nicht zu strafen."
2,1,1,Good news! He's a hanging judge!
4,0,0,You should probably consider actually letting this jury live.
4,0,0,I think I can get you life!
2,0,1,Juror number three is pro life.
4,0,0,Try not to show any emotion when the verdict is read.
2,1,0,I'm feeling good about a hung jury!
2,2,0,The scythe didn't fit.
1,0,3,I must advise you that it looks grim.
2,1,0,This puts a new spin on "Dead Man Walking"
4,0,0,So, you're telling me that the death penalty isn't even on the table?
2,2,0,They've reduced the charges to only 45 billion counts of first-degree murder.
3,0,1,Finding an unbiased jury might be a problem.
4,0,0,Death was the best I could do but I thought you'd be ok with that.
2,1,0,You've got stop saying 'It was just his time.'
4,0,0,I know I said this would be pro bono but your hands are making me feel anti bono
3,0,0,I really don't think they'll seek the death penalty
0,3,1,No, a hung jury isn't what we're looking for.
2,2,0,Relax. You look nothing like the police sketch.
3,1,0,I've filed a motion for change of venue to Hades.
2,0,1,Perhaps we should discuss a plea bargain.
4,0,0,That's not what I meant by Opt-Out
3,0,1,"You're going to get the life penalty".
3,1,0,Try not to look so smug.
2,2,0,It's not looking good. They want to give you life.
3,1,0,You're the client but, in my opinion, wailing "your time is coming" to the judge is not a winning defense strategy.
2,0,2,The D.A. is offering leniency if you testify against your Boss.
3,0,0,They're debating the life penalty
4,0,0,You're going to have to work some magic on the judge.
2,1,1,Don't forget to look directly at the jury and smile.
4,0,0,Mr Reaper, I've spoken to our P R boys and they REALLY don't think the scythe will make the jury more sympathetic towards you.
2,1,1,You want to offer the Judge 10 MORE years?
4,0,0,I know, but I've got a date to the prom tonight.
4,0,0,We appreciate your fraternal instincts, but we've got this case covered.
3,1,0,That's what you're wearing? Work with me here.
4,0,0,Be more optimistic, I intend to cloke you in an insanity plea!
3,0,0,...the bad news is, you're looking at life without parole.
3,1,0,Just let me do the talking.
4,0,0,Defending yet another shady figure. Good thing justice is blind.
4,0,0,You were right, the jury would have seen through your headless testimony.
3,0,1,Lose the hoodie if I put you on the stand.
3,1,0,My clients don't usually ask for the death penalty
4,0,0,Don't be such a pessimist.
4,0,0,We are going to Trump!
3,1,0,You know, in most cases the petition for clemency is made before the execution
3,0,1,I'm trying to convince them to give you the death penalty.
4,0,0,I don't think the cloak is helping you with the jury...
3,0,0,Our best hope is to do in the judge
2,0,0,No, two LIFE sentences!
4,0,0,"For the record, is 'Gangsta in the Hood' your legal name?
4,0,0,I talked to the prosecutor, he's not going to seek the death penalty
2,1,0,Can you arrange for a hung jury?
3,1,0,Tie! I asked you to please wear a tie.
4,0,0,Not now, Death - I have to finish this trial.
2,2,0,I told them your scythe was a farm implement but they are insisting that it's an offensive weapon
3,0,1,A death sentence is the least of our worries
3,0,1,Yes, the jury of your peers means 12 people just like you.
4,0,0,Well, we're not in Silicon Valley. Here you look like the Unabomber.
3,0,0,Well, they did say they wanted more page views.
3,0,0,Let's take the plea deal
4,0,0,The death penalty?" "But this is a traffic violation!
4,0,0,can you et the death penalty off the table?
2,1,1,I have never seen such a blatant case of profiling.
4,0,0,Now you just need the jury's approval. Then you'll only have twenty-five years to wait!
4,0,0,Listen Grim, Keith Richards is being granted his Restraining Order and the Stones are petitioning for immortality...
4,0,0,I strongly suggest you take the Fifth.
2,1,1,You should have gotten a Concealed Scythe Permit.
4,0,0,We like this judge. Let me do the sidebars, okay?
2,1,0,Good news .... they're offering life.
2,2,0,Be sure to make eye contact with the jurors.
3,1,0,So, we'll challenge any evidence that puts you in the hood that night.
1,2,1,Not that it matters to you, but I have gotten the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,You're off the hook if you get the death penalty Joking aside!
3,1,0,"Our 12 friends might think the robe's cute, but the scythe could be a problem".
3,1,0,Try not to hang the jury, ok?
3,1,0,If things go wrong, you might get the you penalty.
3,1,0,Leroy, its time we face the facts.
1,1,0,I assume you're okay with the death penalty.
3,0,0,Are you sure this is a capital offence?
4,0,0,I thought I told you- only the judge wears a robe. Now sit quietly and stop beckoning to the jurors.
3,0,0,Victims wearing hoodies typically do not fare well.
3,1,0,You gotta trust what I said about the hoodie.
4,0,0,She may have said it, but where's the evidence that she agreed "until death do us part"?
3,1,0,The judge asks that you remove your hood.
4,0,0,The death penalty should be a cinch.
3,1,0,Yes, I know you have some experience with plea bargaining, but let me handle this.
2,1,1,So, you are telling me that the death penalty would be a complement?
2,2,0,OK, that might work, but what about taxes?
2,2,0,When I said we wanted a hung jury, I didn't mean it literally.
2,2,0,Don't worry, I'm excellent at playing the devil's advocate
4,0,0,So uh, is your cloak Gucci?
3,0,0,The Jury finds the defendant, Death, guilty of the murder of 93 billion people.
2,0,1,Joint custody is off the table.
3,1,0,Do you remember if they ID'ed you in the lineup?
2,2,0,Bad news. They found the scythe.
4,0,0,There are some things you'll never have to face.
4,0,0,Casper, they are going to ask you one more time and you have to answer. Can you or can you not walk through walls?
1,2,0,When Her Honor recesses for lunch, we need to get you a tie!
3,1,0,They're threatening to give life.
4,0,0,I would consider "aggravated stalking" a win.
3,1,0,The judge doesn't see why you need to be in the witness protection program!
4,0,0,When I said dress up for court, I didn't mean as the Grim Reaper.
3,0,0,I think you should plead the fifth dimension.
4,0,0,They're threatening to take Death off the table
2,1,0,What do you mean that you and the judge have 'an understanding'?
3,0,1,Worst case scenario? You could get a life sentence.
2,1,0,I’m pretty sure we can’t ask for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Don't ask for the Death penalty
2,2,0,In my view Mr. Reaper, I don't think an entrapment defense will fly.
3,1,0,Granted, for you it wouldn't be a real penalty, but they still want to have their trial.
4,0,0,They want to know where your body's buried.
3,1,0,Y'know, the victim was killed with a scythe.
3,0,1,Your only help is to plead, "Guilty as Hell!"
2,0,1,With the death penalty on the table, I feel like this is a conflict of interest.
3,1,0,When you're on the stand, whatever you do, don't touch the judge.
4,0,0,It's the penalty phase I'd worry about.
4,0,0,What verdict did you expect?
3,1,0,So, if he asks what your occupation is, take the fifth.
3,0,1,Don't wear that hoodie if you don't want to be stereotyped
3,1,0,Sorry, Death, you have been sentenced to life.
4,0,0,Are you sure you want me to defend these Mossack Fonseca allegations with the "Death and Taxes" argument?
4,0,0,...so...HEY! Are you with me on this one?
2,1,0,Sorry, but it looks like you're going to get Life.
4,0,0,Saying that God told you to do it won't get us anywhere.
0,1,2,Let me show you how a real soul-sucking job is done.
3,0,1,That selfie you took on the river Styx really killed your alibi.
1,3,0,I got it reduced to 45 billion counts of second degree murder.
2,2,0,It is very nice to meet you too.
3,0,0,If you're sure they won't testify against you, then don't take the deal.
4,0,0,It's not great, Mr. Reaper, but at least we got the "taxes" part tossed.
1,2,1,"I was just doing my job" is not a good defence.
1,3,0,Ironically, you're facing life in prison.
2,0,0,I never do this, but I'm suggesting you go for the death penalty.
2,1,0,You didn't do yourself any favors with that cologne.
2,0,2,What''s being decided today is the extent of your life, not the jury's.
4,0,0,He hit me first
3,0,0,They need you to try on the gloves.
4,0,0,Even if they don’t buy the argument that your presence was just ‘circumstantial’, Grim, do you really care if they give you death?
3,1,0,I think we can get you off with life.
3,1,0,Face it, you're dead.
3,0,0,Remember, our relationship is strictly privileged and confidential. But after this is over I expect to never, ever see you again.
3,0,1,I'm not sure the occupational hazard exception applies in your case.
4,0,0,It's an open-and-shut case. Nobody remembers your face.
4,0,0,I don't think we can rely solely on your Second Amendment rights.
3,0,1,This is not what I meant when I said I needed a dramatic closing.
3,1,0,Don't worry, you're not the most guilty person I've defended.
1,2,1,I'm afraid you got life.
4,0,0,I understand--but do your best to make eye contact with the jury anyway.
4,0,0,Welp, so much for habeas corpus.
4,0,0,We're looking at death
3,0,1,Wait, I'm getting life? This should be interesting.
3,1,0,Usually the other side raises the specter of the death penalty.
2,2,0,On second thought, the maximum sentence might be OK.
3,0,1,Remember, the scythe was next to the body when you arrived.
3,1,0,OK, usually it's good to make eye contact with the jurors..............
4,0,0,We need to do this right or you'll get life!
2,0,2,Well, the fact that you're already dead might work in our favor.
2,2,0,I don't know why you chose me, I'm a tax attorney.
4,0,0,I don't think the Dead Man's Statute is a defense here.
3,0,0,You're the injured party. It wouldn't hurt to show some emotion.
4,0,0,Remember, always make eye contact with the Jury, I think we are winning them over
4,0,0,We have to do some real work here to overcome your bad press.
3,0,0,As for that 'inevitable' crap, the IRS wants to own it.
2,1,0,You sure this is the only way to avoid jail time?
3,1,0,I swear, I'm off weekends.
3,1,0,The judge would like to plea bargain with you.
3,1,0,Remember: You’re the EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGED Reaper.
4,0,0,I think it might be time to challenge them to a game a chess.
2,0,0,The charge is life insurance fraud.
4,0,0,You want how many other offences taken into consideration?
2,1,1,What do you mean, I'm in a lot of trouble if we lose?
4,0,0,Perhaps advocating for the death penalty is a little premature.
1,2,1,Of course you're guilty.
3,1,0,All things considered, I'd advise you not to testify.
2,1,1,I would advise you not to unjustly collect the plaintiff's soul. The judge could hold you in contempt.
3,0,1,You've got a little something between your teeth.
2,2,0,By the way, for my fee...I'd like my soul back.
3,1,0,It's kind of ironic that you got life.
4,0,0,That's a hung jury they are reporting. Hung. No hanged.
4,0,0,As the attorney defending you against a mass murder charge, I have to ask you, "Who picked your outfit?"
2,2,0,You're being charged with aiding and abetting.
4,0,0,I advise you to plea, "Let me be me."
3,1,0,This is going to be so ironic if you get the death penalty.
3,0,1,We need a change of venue--any place that's not Florida.
4,0,0,At least this state no longer has the death penalty.
3,0,0,Smile a lot.
4,0,0,One more positive ID and we're in big trouble.
1,2,0,This issue has been briefed to death.
3,0,1,But it's only a parking ticket.
3,0,1,Could I get that in writing?
4,0,0,"Til death do us part" does NOT give you carte blanche.
3,1,0,It looks like the prosecutor is going to offer you life
3,1,0,Look at the bright side, they named your penalty after you.
4,0,0,It's The People vs. the Undertaker. There's no way they win.
4,0,0,You'd better start preparing to get a life !
3,1,0,What do you mean you don't care that this is a death penalty case?
4,0,0,You're lucky, this state has no Death penalty.
4,0,0,I really think the jury is starting to see you less as the "Grim Reaper", and more as just "Death".
3,0,0,If they ask you your name is "G.R.". Put your game face on and don't be so grim.
4,0,0,I don't think I can sell the jury on, "Come on baby(Don't fear the reaper.)"
2,2,0,I think we have a good shot at avoiding a life sentence.
4,0,0,Did you go over all your aliibis?
3,1,0,Would you settle for life without possibility of parole?
4,0,0,Wait, you WANT to be on Death Row?
4,0,0,Remember, you're taking the Fifth.
4,0,0,Yes, but yours is not a faceless crime in the traditional sense.
2,2,0,Frankly, you've got the face of a killer.
2,1,0,As heinous as it was, he says he will dismiss your case with the proviso you never set foot in this county again.
4,0,0,I'm hoping not to receive a you sentence.
4,0,0,No Grim Reaper! Death is your job. We can't argue it wasn't premeditated.
3,1,0,Yes, it's a penalty. And this is another reason you should let me do the talking.
4,0,0,If you plead guilty, they will take the death penalty off the table.
4,0,0,If we take a plea deal, I might be able to get your sentence reduced to negligent homicide.
4,0,0,They must convict, if the hoodie fits.
3,0,0,Capital punishment infringes upon your exclusive performance rights.
1,1,2,We'll ask for separate trials on each count.
4,0,0,You know I'm having a hard time reading you, is it guilty or not guilty of murder.
4,0,0,My advice is lose the hood.
4,0,0,That's not exactly what I had in mind when I said to wear a killer outfit.
4,0,0,If we lose, you could still get time off for good behavior
3,1,0,Bad news. They're going for the life sentence.
2,1,0,I'm sure we can get an acquittal , but you have to appear more like likeable.
4,0,0,Honestly, I don't think anyone will believe she broke the infidelity clause.
3,0,1,Bad news. They're going for the 'you' penalty.
3,1,0,I think you should quit your day job.
4,0,0,Another continuance, right?
2,2,0,I'm sorry but this state no longer has the death penalty.
3,1,0,Just to confirm, you want to plead guilty.
4,0,0,Mr. Reaper, didn't we agree on a new hood when the charge is murder?
1,1,2,Bad news. Your priors are admissible.
4,0,0,Taxes. Yep, you and taxes.
3,1,0,Whoever it was they didn't leave any fingerprints.
4,0,0,Being sick of talking heads is not a defense.
2,2,0,I have to say things look pretty grim.
3,1,0,Scalia? He's the one in the middle, next to Roberts.
2,2,0,Did my assistant discuss with you how to dress at trial?
4,0,0,Trust me; they haven't got a ghost of a chance.
3,1,0,It's the jury of your peers that worries me.
3,1,0,I need to be honest with you. The outlook is grim.
3,1,0,The situation looks grim.
3,1,0,Divorce Court
4,0,0,Life is the best we can hope for.
4,0,0,I think it's to play the wraith card.
4,0,0,Shall I go "talk" to the jury?
3,0,1,We're hoping to keep the scythe out of evidence.
3,0,1,You did say you were innocent, right?
2,0,1,Unfortunately, some of the jurors are against the death penalty.
2,1,0,Just doesn't work without the scythe.
4,0,0,I hear you, but innocent until proven guilty just isn't going to work for us here.
4,0,0,I blame Frank Luntz. The judge is ruling that the Estate Tax name change means you owe a bundle in back taxes.
3,0,1,...don't even think about it
3,0,0,You do not drink, So what the hell where you doing that night at the pub?
3,1,0,No, no, no - You're GETTING the death penalty
4,0,0,You have nothing to lose.
3,1,0,Fortunately they don't have your fingerprints
3,0,0,I'll need you to put on a good face in front of the jury.
4,0,0,If you want to win this thing please be not proud.
4,0,0,Chances
4,0,0,Just remember they have to prove you were there.
2,2,0,A death sentence will not change your life in any way.
4,0,0,What's wrong with my tie?
4,0,0,It's not as grim as it seems.
4,0,0,Good news! I got your second life term cut in half!
2,1,1,Ask the judge if you can approach, maybe it'll sway him.
1,2,1,I expect some difficulty seating an unbiased jury.
3,1,0,I'm not asking for the death penalty
1,3,0,I don't think you have a ghost of a chance.
4,0,0,He's about to get jail for life...trust me on this one, death
4,0,0,We've got an Evangelical jury. Try to play more "Angel" than "of Death".
3,0,1,I assume you're not concerned about the death penalty...
2,0,0,I can get a continuance if you think it might help.
3,0,1,Yes, I think having one of them drop dead would be considered "jury tampering."
2,1,0,Are you sure you knocked before barging through the door?
4,0,0,Guilty. The good news is you're getting life in prison.
2,0,1,My fault -- I did tell you to dress in business attire.
3,1,0,OK, but this in the last time ...............who's there?
2,1,0,Talk about a dead-to-rights case.
2,0,2,Listen....I was just doing my job is not a defense.
4,0,0,We're done for. They found evidence of your involvement with GMO distribution.
4,0,0,How about we file for a writ of habeas corpus?
4,0,0,Charcoal Portrait of Lawyer and Generic client
4,0,0,Motion denied.
4,0,0,We could argue no one actually saw you.
2,2,0,Your attire is inappropriate for an alleged serial killer.
4,0,0,Remember: Don't look the jury in the eye.
4,0,0,You should have gone with the plea bargain.
3,1,0,The jury's here... look innocent.
1,2,0,The judge said that you have no appeal.
3,1,0,I think our best chance is to claim racial profiling. We should be able to get the 'black guy in a hoodie' description thrown out.
3,1,0,Lucky for you, we don't have the death penalty here.
2,0,0,I know you look forward to a hung jury, but I'd like to win this.
4,0,0,They confiscated your scythe because you keep raggin' on all that "harvester of souls" nonsense.
3,0,0,Are you saying you don't want Life?
3,0,1,It's looking good, still no available witnesses.
4,0,0,I'll promise the jury you won't come calling anytime soon.
2,1,1,Well, we can't really deny that you did it.
4,0,0,Plead the Fifth.
2,0,0,Sorry, but "until death do us part" won't be a good defense
2,1,1,Guess who's turning state's evidence against you--your good buddy, Taxes.
2,2,0,No, the teeth are fine. Juries like toothy. But let's just get you some wax lips, eh?
4,0,0,They got you on intent.
3,0,1,I think we can get it reduced to manslaughter.
2,0,0,I don't think I can defend this much longer.
4,0,0,Did someone advise you to refrain facial expression?
2,2,0,Wait a minute...you want the Death Penalty?
2,1,1,If you're found guilty, they'll give you *you*.
4,0,0,You do realize this may mean life.
4,0,0,Don't look so guilty!
1,2,1,They’re offering to reduce your time if you increase theirs.
2,1,0,If this thing goes south, we can always play the wraith card.
3,0,1,Calm down, I'm pretty sure the death penalty isn't an option.
4,0,0,It's the third time that you did this when I asked about my bill.
3,0,0,Believe me, I am trying hard to conceal the secrets of your " shell corporation....! "
4,0,0,You have the right to remain silent, but it'll look like you're hiding something.
4,0,0,Your hoodie is sentenced to ten years with no parole.
4,0,0,No you can't tell the judge you have met Justice Scalia.
4,0,0,It's still considered a penalty in the eyes of the law.
2,2,0,I'm worried that the prosecution will be asking for the death penalty.
3,1,0,They're giving you life.
4,0,0,There's no plea bargain... is there?
4,0,0,Are those Warby Parker glasses? I want to get a pair soon too
2,2,0,I think I can get it down to manslaughter.
4,0,0,Either way it's a death sentence.
3,1,0,No, I don't think juror number five recognizes you.
3,1,0,Have you thought about pleading guilty?
3,0,0,Show some remorse and apologize to the family members of the jury.
4,0,0,If you are found guilty, may I have your sickle collection?
4,0,0,Try to look at the bright side; You did steal the wheat but I think I can get you off for wrongful death.
3,1,0,Yes, it's called a "wrongful death" case, but could you try to take it a little less personally?
4,0,0,So you've received the death penalty before?
3,1,0,Remember "just doing my job" is not an affirmative defense.
3,0,0,Mortal coil? Not me, lawyer client privilege!
2,0,0,The families of your D-Train and cinder block murders are suing you for millions.
4,0,0,They want to ask you about the custom of beheading, not the costume you wear to do it.
2,0,2,I'm your third lawyer. What happened to the other two?
3,0,1,I think you're right to contest the parking ticket. Death would be, in most cases, a valid handicap.
3,1,0,FYI. My death eventuates an immediate IRS audit of your tax filings.
3,1,0,The ultimate tweet has been tweeted.
2,0,1,Look whose calling who an "empty suit".....
4,0,0,We can beat this.
3,1,0,Good news. The judge is an existentialist.
2,1,1,A life sentence? Are you sure?
2,2,0,"I was just doing my job" is not going to be a winning defense.
3,1,0,No, that would be cruel and unusual in this state.
3,1,0,I gotta be perfectly honest here. Your situation is pretty grim.
2,2,0,He's not buying the "It's my job" argument.
4,0,0,Can you give me 5 hours? I need to hit my billable requirement this month.
4,0,0,Somehow I just don't think that ' Guilty, With An Explanation' will work .
3,1,0,Actually, your not doomed to indictment.
3,1,0,I recommend avoiding eye contact with the jury.
2,1,1,How can house arrest be a 'horrible' outcome?
4,0,0,You don't have to worry about the death penalty
3,0,1,Now's your last chance: Have you ever killed anyone before?
4,0,0,You want my advice? Smile a little, look alive, try and show some remorse--otherwise you're lookin' at Death!
4,0,0,I suppose not seeing you smirk can help.
3,1,0,Stay away from any radical comments on the death penalty if they don't confirm you.
2,2,0,Looks like you'll have plenty of time for chess.
3,1,0,I defend politicians; this will be easy.
3,0,0,Try to look innocent, and especially, vulnerable.
4,0,0,I'm sure you do indeed find it comical to be told by the judge that your case looks grim - but I really do need you to focus right now.
2,1,0,You couldn't shave?
3,1,0,The good news is the Death Penalty is off the table.
2,1,0,Relax. A hundred-billion deaths, sure—but no witnesses.
3,1,0,Would it have killed you to wear a jacket and tie?
4,0,0,Do you think the glove will fit?
4,0,0,Remember, we are going for a temporary insanity verdict.
3,1,0,What happens if you get the death penalty?
3,1,0,You can't ask for the death penalty instead of paying your parking tickets.
3,0,1,To be honest, you look like a good candidate for the death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm sure you will be happy to hear it's a hung jury.
3,1,0,Will you have to recuse yourself because of my brush with death?
4,0,0,You're saying that I'm still on the hook for this?
4,0,0,We're doing okay, but you're gonna have to testify.
4,0,0,I really don't think that it is a good idea to put you on the stand.
1,1,2,Three words of advice if you want to win this: Be not proud.
3,0,0,Well, the State's not budging on this coaching youth hockey thing.
2,1,1,Hung jury is not what you think it is.
3,1,0,Could have been worse. You could have gotten back-to-back life sentences.
3,1,0,I'm thinking the hood defense--If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
4,0,0,You didn't tell me you were sleeping with her.
4,0,0,Can we get Scalia back, just until November?
1,2,1,We have to play the 'troubled childhood' card.
