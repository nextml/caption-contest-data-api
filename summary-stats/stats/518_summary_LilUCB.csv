35,2,0,Gee, I guess we'll have to go find another island.
47,33,8,He'll NEVER ask for directions.
37,15,6,Maybe he'll let us bury him.

16,1,0,All these years he insists he's a camel exploring the desert.
20,5,0,We should give him a flare gun.

15,3,0,Acting like at cat at his age isn't funny.
23,2,0,Looks like malicious code to me too

24,5,2,That's it. I'm calling the super to fix the indoor plumbing.
28,9,3,He can't see the sand for the box.
29,10,3,My dad gets dramatic when we run out of bottled water.

19,5,0,Just 5 more minutes.
20,2,0,There used to be three ghosts. Daddy calls it a mirage a blah.

29,5,2,I’d call the authorities, but I don’t want to make waves.
21,3,1,He swears his geo-cache led him here...

19,3,0,We're ready,,turn on the mirage.
33,2,6,I can see the appeal of adult coloring books, but these adult sandboxes are downright depressing.
16,0,0,I'd say licking himself is the worst part of his morning ritual.
25,4,3,Could your dad relive his traumas elsewhere?
17,1,0,He said he was trying to find himself, but I think he just meant his contacts.
17,2,0,I would crawl across a sandbox with no water for you too.
