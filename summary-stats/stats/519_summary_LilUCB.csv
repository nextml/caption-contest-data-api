14,4,0,Ahem! I believe it was your idea to adopt............
14,1,0,Now, who's here a bird brain?!
13,2,0,He's really rather harmless. In his mind he's guarding Buckingham Palace.
14,4,0,His family says that he is not allowed to talk about his line of work.
16,5,1,I think it's known as a peep sight.
18,2,0,Friggin' Smartass!
13,1,0,Benedict Quailnold.
15,2,1,I can't believe he got the job. He didn't even know how to whistle!
17,8,0,Must be first day of rabbit season.
18,2,3,Bastard!
13,3,0,Apparently he just finished the first Chapter in Sun Tzu’s book, Keep Your Friends Close and Your Enemies Closer.
24,13,6,The sparrows call that "riding shotgun".
12,1,0,Not effective camo.
13,3,0,Let's stay in the bush.

19,4,2,I've heard of symbiotic relationships but that's just a plain death wish.
13,2,0,She's not to be rifled with.
13,2,0,So what happened to his mate?

14,3,0,You know, the extreme sports movement is getting out of hand.

14,2,1,Shoot.
18,3,0,My boy hasn't outgrown his high-risk behavior.
12,0,0,No, no, if he was in his hand he'd be worth as much as us.
15,6,0,C'mon - you think a bird on a rifle is really worth more than two in the bush?
13,3,0,He sold us out for some grains and seeds.
19,5,2,In this case, I'm inclined to think that two in the bush are better.
13,0,0,Look at that sexy.
13,1,0,A yellow-bellied stool pigeon, if I'm not mistaken.

17,3,2,I really admired his work in the Woodstock poster.
25,1,0,Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we're one myopic hunter short of the classic Whip Poor Will maneuver.
16,3,0,Season's first Benedicta Arnolda.
15,4,1,We're not in the clear until he moves down to his hand.

14,4,0,Sycophant.
13,1,0,He's either a decoy or deeply disturbed.

12,2,0,Come on bro, be a good wingman and distract her friend.
21,11,4,Looks like Elmer has a new twitter follower.
12,1,0,A bird is known by the company it keeps.

17,6,1,She's telling us old George forgot his glasses again.
17,4,2,You know he was voted 'most likely to be in the hand' in high school.

8,0,0,It's the art of war my friend.
13,2,0,Just go give her a little peck. Trust me, it will blow your mind!
20,4,3,I told you that small egg looked cuckoo to me.
18,2,0,That's not the kind of shoot we taught her to sit on.
25,17,7,Well that explains the fancy birdhouse and expensive suet.
17,6,2,I double dared him.
14,0,1,He must be related to Bernie Sanders.
18,5,2,There's a good example of keeping your enemies closer.

15,4,1,Sally's such a show off.
19,2,3,Even if he ends up 'in the hand,' no way is he worth more than you and me.
15,1,0,Can you tell which of them is being taken for a ride?
16,2,0,See, it's a cardinal sin.
12,1,0,So, it is true. The NRA is for the birds.
19,5,3,He's actually a double agent.
14,4,1,No, it's true. As long as you're sitting there, he can't shoot you.
12,2,0,Not to worry...it's just a presidential candidate looking for a photo-op

18,7,2,Let's hope he's a bird in hand type of guy.
16,11,0,We let him learn through trial and error
24,8,6,I am definitely tweeting this.
17,3,2,And you thought tweeting online was dangerous
12,1,0,It says a "a bird in hand..." NOT "a bird on a rifle ...."
9,1,0,He's got a bird in the hand, but we're worth just as much.

15,0,0,One in hand is worth two in the bush
15,5,1,Now that's a Cuckoo bird.
15,3,1,Now that's what I call a well-regulated militia.
16,7,0,That way, when he tweets, he can see who his followers are.
16,2,2,And they disparage us as "bird brains."
13,3,1,I swear, they get dumber every year.
12,3,0,He's always been one to hang out with the wrong crowd.
14,1,1,She forgot her selfie stick again.
20,7,4,I told you he needed glasses.
12,0,0,The kid thinks marching around in the weeds grousing about with that guy is okay wait till he turns it around and starts the shoot em up.
11,1,0,That little twerp always calls shotty.
14,2,1,It's still better than two in the bush. I think we're safe.
14,5,2,well, can you think of a safer spot?
16,3,0,I bet now he thinks he's better than us.
12,1,0,I think our son needs a second.
17,9,1,I wouldn't want to add either to my professional network.
17,6,1,Obviously another severe case of Stockholm Syndrome.
14,0,0,That is not our son, look at the dull plumage.
12,0,0,who's the fool?
24,7,6,Impressive. Personally, I would have chosen "Truth".

12,2,0,I told he was an informant.
18,8,2,I hear he joined the NRA.
12,2,0,He'll never think to look there.
16,3,1,That's why we call him Robin the Boy Wonder.
15,6,0,Let's face it. Junior just isn't that bright.
18,10,1,I have been warning Simon about hitchhiking for years.
20,9,3,So, should we be, like, live tweeting this before he bites the bullet?
19,7,1,Do we really need empirical evidence that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
17,1,0,I am so glad we bought our son one of those smart phones with GPS. It is so much easier to track down the hunters.
13,3,0,He's always showing off.
17,9,1,There's our adrenaline junkie.
13,3,0,He's a pretty good shot but his sense of awareness is poor.
12,1,0,I'd say he has a "death wish"
14,5,0,I suppose you could say he has a bird's eye view.
20,6,4,Talk about endangered species!
18,4,2,You think that's brave do you. Watch me land on his hat.
16,5,1,maybe he should have taken truth.
19,5,3,Hiding in plain gun sight?
20,5,1,Dude, he is so grounded.
15,2,0,Imbedded. But starting to go soft on them.
18,7,2,That's the last place he'll look
14,0,1,Good thing Robin sends out tweets constantly.
15,3,2,If I understand the math, he should feel a trickle down his neck soon."

11,0,0,I hope she doesn't get shipped out to the Middle East.
25,10,7,I'm telling you, Larry's got Stockholm Syndrome.
11,0,0,It's one of those newfangled social media sights---when you're on target, it tweets.
18,7,1,"Do you think he knows he's not sitting on a branch?
17,6,1,Brilliant! He's hiding in plain gun-sight.
12,1,0,Little Jackson is convinced he can change the entire hunting paradigm.
16,5,1,Now there's a guy who lives on the edge!
12,1,0,Just spit-balling here, but I bet the intersection of Mensa membership and NRA membership is the null set.
13,0,0,One smart bird.
13,1,0,We're a little more gun-shy.
16,2,0,What's the old saying? A bird on the gun is worth two in the bush.
14,3,1,They met while tweeting.

18,1,3,Just because it's different doesn't mean it's wrong.
16,8,0,I hope the hunter is far sighted...
18,6,2,Oh, she's game all right.
17,4,1,I mean I knew he was depressed, but geez!
16,5,1,Should we tell him where the Bernie rally is?
16,7,0,Now if he can somehow get to the bullets...
13,4,0,Pff, what a bird-brain.
11,0,0,You guys take the bush. I'll take the barrel.

16,4,1,We forgot one lesson.
17,4,1,Well, I guess in theory that is the safest place to be.
19,9,2,That's why I never ride shotgun.
18,10,1,She's always attracted to the wrong guy.

12,1,0,Name had me minimizing the threat, but I never trusted that variety of pigeon.
12,1,0,Quisling quail.
13,2,0,If that's what belongs to the NRA, not to be concerned.

21,12,3,Evolution works in mysterious ways.
19,8,3,When you think about it, he's actually got the safest seat in the woods.

14,1,1,We need cool hats.
16,5,2,Someone should tell him that "Hunting is for the birds" is a figure of speech."
23,9,5,I know they say keep your enemies close, but this seems dangerous.
19,9,2,It's probably safer than where we are right now!
19,5,2,I think his plan is about to backfire.

54,61,34,This gives a whole new meaning to "riding shotgun."
16,5,1,'Time to push him out of the nest' you said. 'Time to push him out of the nest.'

13,3,0,I didn't think he'd take "know thine enemy" literally.
9,1,0,Not all them gun tote'n rednecks are killers.
13,1,0,Tweety Gandhi has his own approach.

12,1,0,I guess the early bird gets the buck
31,16,12,Dumb and dumber.
12,1,0,He's always looking for an opportunity to exercise his second amendment rights.
16,4,1,It's a good thing we're not an endangered species.
11,0,0,That hat doesn't fool me.
20,13,3,We didn't prepare him for the real world.
18,2,3,If he gets that in his hand, we're safe.
22,8,4,He's worth two of us.
12,1,0,Logically, I know that it's meant to draw us out, but emotionally, all I want is to flap my wings and create a stir.
12,0,0,I don't think you want to be on that perch
20,8,3,His Father was a stool pigeon!

30,12,11,A clear case of Stockholm syndrome.
12,2,0,Touch the butt!
12,2,0,Do you think that's crazy or for the birds?

22,9,4,He's got to learn to fly some day.
14,0,1,He's gauging the wisdom of flying straight ahead.
16,5,0,He always tries to be the oddball.
20,1,0,That still doesn't make you a Cuckoo bird!
27,29,7,Teenagers. They think they're invincible.
